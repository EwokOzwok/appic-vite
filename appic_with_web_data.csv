We are committed to providing comprehensive training that supports interns in developing their unique clinical voice while gaining the skills and competencies necessary for independent practice. AMS Wellness values each intern’s own specialized clinical interests, experiences, and clinical approach, which we are passionate about cultivating and further tailoring. The internship program emphasizes comprehensive training in evidence-based interventions and culturally responsible care across diverse client populations. AMS Wellness is grounded in the Practioner-Scholar model. The internship program prioritizes clinical training, while encouraging interns to engage with current psychological research to inform ethical and effective practice. AMS Wellness is committed to fostering professional identity development, self-reflection, and personal wellness. In addition, AMS encourages all staff members to practice self-care, both professionally and personally. To support this goal during internship, we provide the supervision and resources that foster a balanced and authentic internship experience. An internship with AMS Wellness will include one year of full-time training, meeting the 2,000-hour requirement. The training year begins July 6, 2026, and ends July 6, 2027. Interns will work with a wide range of clientele, therapeutic modalities, diagnostic evaluations, and opportunities for the interns to provide supervision to a practicum student. This full-time breakdown of hours consists of 32 on-site hours and an additional 8 hours that may be completed from home. On site hours should consist of all billable client interactions, both clinical and diagnostic, to ensure that the assigned daily supervisor is available for all emergency situations. This would include consistently working with 16 to 18 clients per week, both in person and telehealth, using HIPAA compliant Zoom. In addition, interns are expected to complete ten diagnostic evaluations in the training year. Outside of billable interactions with clients, interns oversee all communication and scheduling with clients, as well as preparing and submitting all weekly notes through our electronic housing system (Therapy Appointment), completing quarterly DCFS reports, and completing monthly diagnostic reports. In addition to their clinical work, interns are offered the opportunity to provide didactic training to master’s and doctoral externs related to their dissertation, as well as offer the opportunity to provide peer supervision to an extern for the year. For example, interns will be provided with the opportunity to provide supervision to participating in diagnostic externs, which would include assisting in scoring material and case conceptualizations, as well as reading first drafts of their reports. While our training site’s aim is to develop clinicians who have their own voice and support them in pursuing specializations based on their interests, AMS is passionate about teaching the importance of a balanced home and work life to avoid burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious trauma. As a result, we encourage all staff members to engage in self-care, allowing them to be the best version of themselves, both professionally and personally. To support this goal during internship, we provide the supervision and resources for an authentic and balanced experience. This begins with multiple layers of supervision. Each intern will receive two hours of individual supervision from two licensed AMS Wellness psychologists per week. Our supervision is based on a developmental model of supervision that allows interns to experience growth at both the individual and professional level. To do so, each supervisor focuses on creating a warm and safe supervisor-supervisee relationship, which allows the intern to see the impact that a strong therapeutic relationship can have on their individual growth. The quality of training experiences combined with the extensive supervision by licensed psychologists, will enhance the intern’s self-development as a therapist and allow them to learn their own supervising style. The training experiences at AMS Wellness are focused on integrating all their prior training and deepening their self-reflective skills to become the future psychologist that they aspire to become. An additional two hours of group supervision will be provided per week with licensed clinical psychologists to allow each intern to have an additional space to process their roles as therapists and diagnosticians. In addition to scheduled supervision hours, interns have access to their on-site supervisor for informal consultation as needed throughout the day, ensuring timely clinical support and continuity of care.

Interns will work 40 hours per week for 52 weeks, excepting vacation and sick days. Hours include direct service, support activities such as report writing, supervision, and didactic seminars. Direct service hours include assessment, therapy, and intake evaluations. Training during this internship includes assessment, individual therapy, and neurodivergent populations. Some case management and crisis management training may be obtained as relevant for clients on the intern’s caseload. Interns may also choose to receive training in forensic evaluation or group services such as psychoeducational or support groups. Approximately fifty to sixty percent of the time on-site is spent delivering direct care services. Responsibilities and clinical hours will increase over the course of the training year. Interns will engage in two simultaneous clinical rotations: assessment and therapy. Interns may elect to focus more heavily on assessment or therapy depending on clinical interests but are expected to complete a minimum 50 percent of their clinical hours via assessments and have a minimum therapy caseload of three-to-four clients at a time. Interns who are interested in providing other services, such as psychoeducation or groups, are welcome to set up these services with our clinical staff. Other clinical duties include intake evaluations, report writing, supervision, didactic trainings, and engagement with research literature. Interns will begin their training process by completing several trainings, didactic presentations, and observations of staff completing assessments during their first week. Training will progress depending on intern needs. Over the next few weeks, observation of staff assessments will continue, and interns will begin completing assessment intake interviews. Interns may begin taking therapy clients. They will be observed by a staff member for at least one administration of each test before administering any test on their own. Independent assessments will begin with selected less-complex referral questions and progress to more complex presentations based on intern readiness. Interns will observe some of the results sessions for clients they evaluated, and gradually complete increasing portions of the results sessions on their own with a licensed clinician present. Report writing will also be completed on a graduated basis, with an increasing amount of responsibility and number of reports to be completed as the internship progresses. Interns will receive their own office in our suite. All intern offices contain appropriate furniture for both assessment and therapy, a secure location for storing files, and a window. Our suite also offers separate assessment rooms, a comprehensive library of tests and clinical references, and a kitchen. Access to various online trainings is provided. Interns and other staff members are encouraged to attend the annual Connecticut Psychological Association Conference, and attendance costs for this conference are covered. All training is provided at our office in Woodbridge, Connecticut. Located just north of New Haven with views of the beautiful West Rock State Park, our location offers convenience to many of Connecticut’s greatest resources. Whether you prefer downtown New Haven, the beach, or walks through the woods, it’s all within a short drive of our practice.

Program Description The CSUDH SPS training program is a 12-month, 2,000-hour, full-time doctoral internship that follows the practitioner-scholar model. The training program is designed with a developmental approach, focusing on basic skills and knowledge in the beginning and building to more complex integration of skills and clinical application. Interns will gain proficiency in the nine core competencies defined by the American Psychological Association. The internship program creates a welcoming, supportive, and encouraging learning environment for all interns. Interns are provided with extensive opportunity for interns to gain sufficient knowledge and experience in being able to deliver culturally-informed mental health services to a wide range of clients within a university setting. The program is designed to foster intern growth through experiential learning under the supervision of an experienced licensed psychologist. Interns are provided with the opportunity to delve into psychological literature to inform their theoretical orientation and intervention strategies. The training curriculum provides interns with a breadth of knowledge, skills, and clinical application in all aspects of the training program. Interns gain experiential knowledge as they spend at least 25% of their time in direct service work with clients. Direct service includes individual counseling, intake assessments, triage and crisis intervention, group therapy, workshops, and outreach events. Weekly 2-hour didactic seminars are designed to further support interns in providing culturally-informed mental health services to clients within and outside of a university setting. Interns spend at least 10% of their time in supervisory activities where they continue to hone the application of their knowledge and skills. Interns are provided with at least 2 hours per week of individual supervision per week.

Our interdisciplinary training program provides psychology practicum trainees, psychology interns, postgraduate social workers and postgraduate pre-licensed mental health counselors an opportunity to expand their clinical training in psychodynamic, relational and attachment-based psychotherapy approaches. While our training program offers advanced training in relational psychodynamic psychotherapy, it is designed to provide a broad range of clinical experiences, client populations, and theoretical approaches consistent with internship-level training in health service psychology. We offer individual and couples therapy to adults of all ages and our treatment model is heavily influenced by culturally informed relational, psychodynamic and attachment-based treatment approaches, although our clinical team is trained in a variety of other treatment approaches. We value the flexibility to deliver integrative treatment approaches to best meet our clients’ needs. We are committed to offering mental health services in an inclusive setting, anchored in a social justice framework, and are passionate about providing psychotherapy services to clients across all identities, experiences and backgrounds. CAS serves over 600 clients at any given time, approximately half of whom are college or graduate students. Approximately 42% of CAS clients identify as BIPOC, 45% as LGBTQ+ and 20% as both BIPOC and LGBTQ+. CAS serves clients seeking services for a wide variety of clinical presentation and presenting concerns, including, but not limited to: • Academic Concerns • Anxiety Disorders • Career and Work-Related Concerns • Chronic Illness • College Adjustment • Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder • Dissociation • Divorce • Gender Dysphoria • Gender Identity • Grief • Identity • Life Transitions • Mood Disorders / Depression / Bipolar Disorder • Polyamorous / Consensual Non-Monogamous Relationships • Posttraumatic Stress Disorder • Quality of Life • Racial Identity • Relational Issues (Peer, Couples, Family) • Self-Esteem • Sexual Identity • Social Oppression Related to Race, Ethnicity, Nationality, Gender, Sexuality, Ability, Religion, Spirituality and / or Socioeconomic Status • Spirituality • Stress • Trauma & Related Disorders CAS offers a full-time 12-month (2000 hour) internship that is ideal for doctoral candidates interested in relational psychodynamic and attachment-based psychotherapy approaches, and in working with emerging adults, college students, and adult populations. The general aim of the internship program is to support interns in developing a proficiency in assessment and intervention skills for adult populations across a wide variety of identities, with a specific emphasis on training in relational psychodynamic psychotherapy. In addition to specialized training in relational psychodynamic and attachment-based psychotherapy, the internship ensures breadth of training through exposure to a wide variety of presenting concerns, treatment modalities, and evidence-based intervention approaches, preparing interns for entry-level independent practice. Interns will learn the basic tenets of relational psychodynamic psychotherapy, including the use of self and relationship to facilitate change in psychotherapy. In collaboration with their supervisors and peers, interns will learn to actively reflect on the therapeutic process and their role in it, in service of utilizing interventions and developing clinical formulations, as well as tailoring treatment plans for their clients. Interns will also be encouraged to critically reflect on the impact of their personal identities and experiences, and the broader systems in which these exist, on their clinical work. Specifically, interns will learn to recognize and understand the: • influence of the unconscious on behavior; • impact of early experience on development; • how the current therapeutic relationship is influenced by clients' early relationships; • benefits and limitations of psychodynamic treatment approaches and when alternative treatment approaches, including specialty treatment or higher levels of care, may be clinically indicated; and • experience of difference and the impact of oppression on their own lives and the lives of clients, including the ability to reflect on the internal unconscious meanings of these experiences and their impact on both the therapeutic relationship and process Our office is located at 10 Concord Avenue in Cambridge / Harvard Square across from the Bard College Longy School of Music and is walking distance from the Harvard Square MBTA station and numerous MBTA bus routes.

Program Description Dr. Inzinna Psychological Services PLLC (DIPS) is a multidisciplinary outpatient psychology practice providing accessible, evidence-based, and compassionate mental health care to adults, adolescents, couples, and families across New York State. The practice offers services through a hybrid model of in-person and telehealth care, allowing flexibility for working individuals, caregivers, and clients in under-resourced or geographically distant communities. Because DIPS accepts insurance, clinicians serve a culturally, linguistically, and socioeconomically diverse population. The Doctoral Internship in Health Service Psychology at DIPS provides full-time, generalist clinical training within a collaborative, team-based private practice environment. Interns gain supervised experience in outpatient psychotherapy, intake and diagnostic assessment, process-based case formulation, treatment planning, documentation, consultation, and professional development. Training emphasizes ethical practice, cultural responsiveness, trauma-informed care, and preparation for independent practice as a health service psychologist. Clinical training is grounded in a Process-Based Therapy (PBT) framework as described by Hayes and Hofmann (2020, 2023). PBT is not a single treatment model, but a scientific approach that organizes psychotherapy around core processes—emotional, cognitive, behavioral, relational, and contextual—that underlie psychological suffering and psychological wellbeing. Interns are trained to understand what processes are most active for an individual in a given context and to select interventions based on principles and mechanisms of change rather than rigid, one-size-fits-all protocols. The program integrates CBT, DBT, ACT, psychodynamic psychotherapy, systems theory, and contextual behavioral science into a coherent, principle-based approach to treatment. Within this framework, DIPS employs Cognitive Behavioral Psychoanalysis (CBP) as its primary therapeutic modality. CBP synthesizes cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic principles through a process-based lens. A central focus of CBP is identifying transdiagnostic patterns of avoidance—emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and relational—that maintain psychological rigidity and distress. Interns learn to help clients approach, experience, and work through avoided material in ways that support new emotional learning, insight into unconscious processes, behavioral flexibility, skill acquisition, and psychological flexibility. The therapeutic alliance is viewed as the foundation for all clinical work. Interns receive a minimum of four hours of weekly supervision, including individual supervision with licensed psychologists and group supervision or case conference. Supervision focuses on clinical formulation, treatment planning, ethical and legal decision-making, risk assessment, professional identity development, and integration of process-based and relational principles. Interns also participate in didactic seminars covering clinical skills, assessment, ethics, professional development, and integrative psychotherapy topics. Assessment opportunities are available when aligned with intern interests and training goals. DIPS is committed to training, mentorship, and professional development as part of its broader mission to strengthen the behavioral health workforce and expand access to high-quality mental health care. Graduates of the internship are well prepared for postdoctoral training and licensure as health service psychologists capable of delivering ethical, effective, and accessible psychological care in contemporary clinical settings.

Program Description The ETSU IIBH Psychology P re-Doctoral Internship program focuses on training interns in the Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) model of integrated care. The IIBH is committed to growing PCBH within rural areas including the Appalachian Highlands. Interns will function as Behavioral Health Consultants (BHC) and are fully integrated members of multidisciplinary teams including physicians, nurse practitioners, resident physicians, medical students, social workers, nurses, and dietitians among others. ETSU has a long tradition of training in healthcare and is committed to improving the health of our region. Interns play a critical role in this mission by improving access, reducing stigma, and addressing biopsychosocial needs. BHCs are generalists equipped to address the breadth of behavioral health presenting concerns in primary care settings including depression, anxiety, trauma, substance use disorders, behavior change, and chronic disease management among others. ETSU Health has a long history of training psychology trainees and is excited to expand our training opportunities to pre-doctoral interns. Internship clinic training sites are part of ETSU Health which operates 30 clinical sites with over 250 providers in northeast Tennessee or collaborating community sites in the Ballad Health region of northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. ETSU Health is the practice affiliate of ETSU, home to five health science colleges. Thousands of healthcare professionals trained through the various colleges at ETSU with a commitment to improving the healthcare and quality of life in both our region, the Appalachian Highlands, and for all rural communities. ETSU has a strong commitment to serving the underserved, addressing social determinants of health, and reducing health disparities of persons living in rural Appalachia. Training sites are within primary care settings including Pediatrics, Family Medicine, and Obstetrics/Gynecology and can include placements in specialty clinics within these practices. Community sites include primary care clinics within the Ballad Health service region. Community placements further the mission of ETSU and IIBH to expand services to rural communities within the Appalachian Highlands. Across training sites, interns will function as BHCs following the PCBH model of integrated care. This model focuses on targeted interventions to improve patient functioning and high accessibility via warm handoffs from medical providers. Interns will be responsible for managing their caseload including the determination of appropriateness for care within the PCBH model versus referral for specialty mental health services , with support in this skill development offered by enthusiastic faculty psychologist supervisors . The majority of intern’s time (80%) is spent on-site at a clinical placement with the remaining 20% protected for professional development, training, and cohort activities (e.g., didactics, group supervision) .

Applicants will be notified prior to December 12, 2025 whether they will be scheduled for an interview at FCI Terminal Island. As part of the interview process, applicants must satisfactorily pass a security clearance procedure that includes a computerized Core Values Assessment (CVA), a pre-employment interview, an integrity interview which addresses issues of personal conduct, a subject matter expert interview, and a drug test. If you are applying to more than one internship site, you may only have to complete this process once. Results of the security clearance procedures can be shared with other Bureau sites for your convenience. However, if you fail any portion of this security clearance at the site where your interview occurs, you will no longer be considered at any of the other sites. Please plan accordingly. The interview process will also include a panel interview in which you will be asked to respond to a number of scenarios that could arise in a correctional facility. These procedures are used to determine your qualifications for a position of public trust and are required of all applicants seeking employment with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Each position requires a commitment of 40 hours per week, with a minimum of 500 hours of direct face-to-face client contact distributed across the twelve-month training period (approximately 15 hours of directclient work/week). We offer 2 hours a week of protected time for students to work on their dissertation, should they be interested, as well as options to work some of the time virtually, if appropriate. Scheduling arrangements are developed collaboratively with supervisors to ensure that training objectives are met while providing interns with authentic exposure to the practical aspects of private practice psychology. Our internship program will be of particular interest to applicants who are preparing for careers in private practice, especially those interested in group private practice settings. The program places significant emphasis on training in integrative therapy approaches while developing a strong foundational understanding of psychodynamic, experiential, and relational theories that inform sophisticated case conceptualization and individualized treatment planning. The GPS internship program offers an exceptional opportunity to receive optional training and clinical experience in neuropsychology, family therapy, couples therapy and sexual health interventions, areas of specialization that are rarely available in other internship settings. This specialized training component represents one of the unique strengths of our program and reflects the expertise of our supervisory faculty in these important areas of clinical practice. Interns are assigned to specialized training experiences based on their clinical interests, career goals, and training needs. Each intern receives intensive training in both assessment and intervention, with supervision provided by doctoral-level psychologists who bring extensive clinical experience and specialized expertise to the training relationship. Interns also have opportunities to co-supervise doctoral-level psychology practicum students, providing valuable experience in supervision and teaching while contributing to the broader training mission of GPS. The internship operates from September 1st to August 31st annually, providing comprehensive training over the full twelve-month period. Interns are entitled to fifteen vacation days, ten sick days, five professional development days, and all statutory holidays recognized in Ontario. The program structure recognizes the importance of work-life balance while ensuring that training objectives are met, and interns gain realistic exposure to the practical aspects of professional psychology practice. The annual stipend for the internship in 2026-2027 is $40,000 CAD, paid biweekly throughout the training year. This compensation reflects our commitment to supporting intern financial wellbeing while maintaining program sustainability and our ability to provide exceptional training experiences. Additionally, each intern receives $1,500 annually for professional development activities, including conference attendance, workshop participation, and professional organization memberships. Our internship site is not currently accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA). However, we are in the process of developing our program in alignment with CPA standards. We understand that the term “non-accredited” can sound concerning at first, but it is important to know that many excellent training sites—especially ones that are newer to offering internships in their private practice setting —begin this way. CPA accreditation is a rigorous and lengthy process that often occurs after a program has been successfully running for several years. In the meantime, students who train at non-accredited sites are still able to complete all necessary requirements for registration in most provinces, particularly when the program follows CPAaligned standards and is supervised by registered psychologists. We are committed to offering a high-quality internship experience that reflects best practices in supervision, training, and ethical care. We are also happy to support students in understanding how this internship fits with their professional goals and future registration plans. GPS has been training PhD-level psychologists in supervised practice for over four decades. Our training initiatives have evolved over the years to now supervising students at earlier stages of their career development, such as the establishment of formal practicum program/external internship placement arrangements with both local universities (Carleton University, University of Ottawa), and more recently, hosting a full-time intern outside of the matching system.

We do this by providing compassionate, integrated care that includes primary medical, mental health, substance use disorder treatment and re-entry services. History HealthRIGHT 360 was founded in 2011 with the merger of Haight Ashbury Medical Clinic and Walden House. The organizations merged on July 1, 2011 to best serve the most vulnerable members of our community. On July 1, 2012, Haight Ashbury Medical Clinics – Walden House adopted a new name: HealthRIGHT 360. Between 2013 and 2017 HealthRIGHT360 (HR360) continued to grow, merging with organizations throughout California, whose mission and services aligned with HR360’s. HR360 provides services throughout California, currently serving thousands of individuals annually in 10 counties (not including jails). The agency serves culturally diverse individuals of all ages, including youth, young adults, and adults. Program Goals The aim of the internship program is to prepare interns to effectively deliver psychological services in community mental health settings, addressing the needs of marginalized populations. Interns will gain experience working with individuals who often face co-occurring disorders, homelessness, and involvement in the criminal justice system. They will develop the skills needed to serve diverse, underserved communities through training in evidence-based interventions, trauma-informed care, and cultural competency. Over the course of the training year, interns will conduct at least four comprehensive psychological assessment batteries, facilitate individual and group therapy, and strengthen their diagnostic, clinical, and case formulation skills. Training Sites All Interns complete the Main Rotation at Adult Outpatient Services. Interns also select minor rotations and can choose 1 to last the entire year or 2 for 6 months each. For example, interns may choose to do a yearlong minor rotation at one of our residential programs focusing on a particular client population such as women with children or may chose 2 six-month minor rotations focusing on inpatient and outpatient populations. Interns will spend two days per week at their minor rotation site providing clinical services, care coordination and receiving onsite training. Through our rotation sites, interns have the opportunity to build and enhance their clinical skills by working with a diverse range of mental health conditions and a variety of clients. They gain experience working with different therapeutic approaches across multiple community settings and levels of care. Rotations will be determined during orientation based on preferences and availability, with final assignments made by the Training Director.

Our program emphasizes the integration of evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) principles with a strong focus on cultural competence, social justice, and systems theory. HPC is dedicated to developing clinicians who can effectively assess, diagnose, and treat a range of mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, trauma, and substance abuse. By focusing on the mental health needs of working-class individuals, HPC aims to reduce disparities in access to care and promote the well-being of underserved communities. Our interns receive rigorous training in CBT, including cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, exposure therapy, and other evidence-based techniques. They are also trained to address the complex interplay between individual and systemic factors that contribute to mental health challenges, such as work-related stress, family dynamics, and cultural pressures. By fostering a deep understanding of these factors, our interns will be well-equipped to provide compassionate and effective care to a diverse range of clients. Honolulu Psychology Collective currently runs three groups actively: CoPA Groups (Co-Parenting PsychoEducation groups), Men’s and Women’s groups focused on marriage and family dynamics, and issues typically focusing around interpersonal relationships. Interns are actively involved in co-facilitating at least one group each semester during the academic year. Typically, interns co-facilitate groups with a faculty member during the first semester. Interns have the opportunity to use their creativity and initiative to create and co-facilitate new groups that align with their interests and meet the needs of the community. These groups can range from process groups to psychoeducational groups, with adequate support and supervision provided as needed​​. The assessment training encompasses the use of various psychological assessments and involves the interpretation of data to formulate and write integrative psychological reports. Interns actively participate in two categories of assessments, (1) Diagnostic Structured Interviews and Self-Report Questionnaires, and (2) cognitive-testing and report writing. HPC requires a benchmark of at least 5 completed integrated psychological reports by the end of the training period. Interns who supervise practicum students receive oversight from a licensed psychologist to ensure they are equipped with the skills needed to provide effective supervision. This process includes regular discussions during individual supervision sessions, where the intern’s supervisory practices are reviewed and guidance is provided to enhance their supervisory competencies. This additional layer of supervision ensures that interns are supported in their dual role as both supervisees and supervisors, promoting growth in their clinical and leadership abilities. Finally interns actively engage in various outreach events as representatives of HPC, collaborating with affiliated agencies and academic institutions on the island of Oahu in the State of Hawaii. This outreach involvement provides opportunities for interns to engage with the roles as community leaders, advocating for mental health in broader contexts.

Program Description The internship training program at Independence Health is developmentally planned and sequentially organized. The internship program recognizes that interns may have little experience in fully integrated models of patient care and specifically in the area of graduate medical education. Interns begin by participating in a comprehensive orientation which is aimed at helping them understand and transition into the Family Medicine Residency Program. This includes a review of the APA Code of Ethics, crisis interventions and safety planning, and PA child abuse laws. Interns are introduced to the importance of the psychologist/physician collaboration, the medical culture, community-based resources, and person-centered health care. Interns appreciate the rich diversity among patients and colleagues, and engage in short-term interventions, assessment, supervision, consultation, research, and teaching strategies through the lens of social justice and equality. Successful interns will have exceptional organizational skills, cognitive flexibility, openness to feedback, and a strong appreciation for a multidisciplinary approach to patient care.

The aim of the Psychology Internship Program is the acquisition and refinement of clinical skills. Upon graduation, we expect our interns to successfully perform counseling, psychological, and assessment services at the entry level. Our Psychology Internship Program at New Directions is dedicated to providing outstanding preparation for psychologists embarking on their professional careers. These initiatives demonstrate the company’s commitment to a results-oriented and evidence-based social service delivery model for its consumers. The internship program utilizes a Mentor-Practitioner model designed to provide close affiliation between the intern and supervisor via the development of a mentoring relationship as a vehicle to focus on strengthening the intern's skills in clinical practice. The New Directions training provides a variety of clinical experiences within our own multi-cultural community (80 percent of our clients come from other states and countries) and in the Broward County community. Our program strives to foster the same diversity in our staff and interns. The mission of New Directions is to assist and empower young adults, families, and community members through comprehensive clinical and social services. It is among the goals of New Directions to promote training opportunities for students and interns in the areas of psychology, assessment services, community outreach, intervention, and consultation. New Directions has encouraged placements of interns, staff, and students in psychology, social work, family therapy, mental health counseling, and education since it began in 2007. We also partner closely with community-based non-profit services that provide internships and jobs to the clients we serve. Training arrangements exist with educational institutions and vocational sites in Broward and Palm Beach Counties. Some of Florida's prominent universities are also located in the area, and student and staff placements have been received from Florida Atlantic University, Lynn University, Nova Southeastern University, Broward College, and the Florida Institute of Technology. We are honored to welcome qualified and diverse interns from accredited universities across the country. New Directions’ mission statement supports the Psychology Training Mission Statement: ""to provide an organized training experience in clinical psychology to interns and equip them with the necessary clinical skills and competencies to successfully perform the role of Psychologists at the entry level."" The Psychology Internship Program provides a generalist clinical training by exposing interns to various clinical/program areas serving diverse clientele. This includes participation in weekly and monthly clinical team meetings with psychologists, LMFTs, psychiatrists, social workers, and other front-line staff, all part of the multidisciplinary treatment team. Interns are fully integrated into New Directions’ program services, working with all levels of staff. Professional development, training, networking, and multi-agency collaboration also occur with other public and private mental health facilities. Interns, graduate students, and staff benefit from diverse opportunities to attend lectures and workshops in these and other facilities. Topics include ASD, family therapy, assessment and management of family violence, sexual, physical, and drug abuse, suicide, bullying, alcohol misuse, cultural diversity, and individual differences in mental health. Interns have access to testing resources/assessments, assessment scoring software, and a wide array of therapy materials for clinical interventions. Additionally, interns are trained in biofeedback and Prism technologies, both utilized at the New Directions clinic. There are various levels of master’s level psychology students in training at New Directions, ranging from first- and second-year practicum students to elective practicum placements and interns. Interns are given the opportunity to supervise practicum students as part of their internship training.

OCFWG provides therapy and psychological testing to children, families, and adolescents. The practice and operated by two licensed clinical psychologists, Dr. Nicole Chavez, and Dr. Parie Faridnia. OCFWG is an established training practicum site since 2017, in which doctoral students obtain clinical expertise under the supervision of Drs. Chavez and Faridnia. The internship is fully integrated into the broader structure of Orange County Family Wellness Group (OCFWG), a multidisciplinary private practice dedicated to prevention, early intervention, and family wellness across the lifespan. Interns are considered valued members of the clinical team and participate in all aspects of the practice’s collaborative model. Training is embedded within OCFWG’s existing systems of care, including weekly case consultations, clinical rounds, staff meetings, and didactic seminars. Interns work alongside licensed psychologists, play therapists, and other mental health professionals, receiving layered supervision and mentorship that connects directly to the organization’s mission of fostering whole-family wellbeing. This structure ensures the internship functions as a coordinated training experience rather than on-the-job service provision, emphasizing growth, reflection, and professional identity development within a supportive clinical community. The Psychology Doctoral Internship at Orange County Family Wellness Group is a full-time, year-long clinical psychology training program. Interns will complete a minimum of 2,000 supervised training hours including: clinical supervision, direct therapeutic and assessment services, interdisciplinary collaboration, and didactic training. Interns in our doctoral psychology internship program have the unique opportunity to earn supervised hours under Registered Play Therapist-Supervisors, Training Director Dr. Parie Faridnia, and/or Psychology Lead/Chief Dr. Nicole Chavez. These supervised hours may be applied toward the requirements for the Registered Play Therapist (RPT) credential, as outlined by the Association for Play Therapy (APT). This specialized training opportunity is designed to enhance clinical competency in play therapy and support future credentialing through APT. The practice serves a diverse population presenting with a wide range of developmental, emotional, and relational concerns. Interns are fully integrated into the practice’s clinical team. Interns at Orange County Family Wellness Group (OCFWG) have access to a range of resources that support high-quality training and client care. The facility includes three fully equipped playrooms: one designed for sand tray therapy, another for arts and crafts-based interventions, and a sensory playroom that fosters regulation and engagement for children with diverse needs. In addition, there are three private offices available for interns to conduct therapy, assessment, and telehealth sessions. Each office is furnished and equipped with computers, secure electronic health record (EHR) software, and HIPAA-compliant telehealth platforms. The practice also provides a variety of clinical and assessment materials, including psychological testing, therapeutic aids, and access to digital resources that support evidence-based practice. Administrative and clerical support are available through OCFWG’s front office team, who assist with scheduling, billing, and client communication. Supervision, case consultation, and didactic training occur weekly and are conducted both in-person and virtually.

Degree Accepted Ed.D. Degree Not Accepted This institution, department, internship, or postdoctoral program requires trainees to sign a statement about personal behavior and/or religious beliefs as a condition of admission and/or retention in the program: No How to obtain text of statement: Other Requirements: Program Description The overall goal of the Private Practice Residency of Ontario in Clinical Psychology (PPRO) is to prepare residents to become competent and autonomous clinical psychologists. Residents will develop skills and knowledge in the areas of culturally sensitive diagnosis, assessment, consultation, treatment, as well as professional and ethical issues. Residents are expected to think critically not only about the services they offer to clients but also about the clinical decisions that they make. We are committed to the scientist-practitioner model. Residents within our program are encouraged to anchor their clinical service in a thorough review of existing scientific literature and evaluate their interventions systematically. In doing so, residents will learn to conduct evidence-based assessment and interventions techniques. We are made up of three sites: 1. Framework Therapy and Assessment Centre (Framework) provides a comprehensive spectrum of mental health care services for children, adolescents, adults, couples, and families. Supported by a team of skilled practitioners – psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech pathologists – we understand that everyone has distinctive needs and can structure a program that best suits you. Our assessment, therapy, counselling, and training services are cutting edge, based on the leading research and best practice guidelines. Our interprofessional team aims to provide evidence-based services that meet our client(s) individual needs. After an initial consultation, we decide together what service(s) best suit their needs. Currently, our services are offered in English, French, Arabic and Hebrew. Our multidisciplinary team comprises practitioners who specialize in providing assessment and treatment/psychotherapy for children, adolescents and adults with: Anxiety, depression, learning disabilities (LD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), personality disorders (e.g., Borderline Personality Disorder; BPD), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), stress related illnesses, sleep related disturbances, substance abuse and eating disorders. 2. Transforming Emotions is a private practice located in downtown Toronto. We are primarily virtual at the time of this writing (Summer 2024), with plans to return to hybrid practice through a central in-person location in downtown Toronto. We typically have 15-20 clinicians in the practice from practicum level through to autonomous psychologists, social workers, and psychotherapists. We work with clients from diverse backgrounds ranging in age from adolescence to age 65. This residency position is focused on working with adult populations. A residency position at Transforming Emotions is ideal for candidates seeking an immersive training experience focused on the theory and practice of Emotion Focused Therapy in the treatment of individual clients. Supervisors vary in their practice with capacity to integrate across modalities including elements of CBT, DBT, MI, and AEDP. Residents new to EFT will focus primarily on working with depression, anxiety, grief, relationship concerns, and life transitions. Those familiar with the model (or who have previously been trained in the treatment of symptoms associated with childhood trauma) are welcome to also work with clients seeking treatment for symptoms typically associated with childhood trauma or post-traumatic stress. 3. Forward Thinking Psychology Services is a multidisciplinary collaborative group practice. Associates in the practice have diverse backgrounds, including a psychologist, social worker, family therapist/parenting coach, psychotherapist, occupational therapist and doctoral level therapists. We all meet once a month to engage in didactic learning, discuss challenging cases and learn from each other in a collaborative space. Trainees find this forum to be exceptional to deepen their learning in addition to the ongoing supervision that is offered weekly. FTPS focuses on the treatment of OCD and anxiety disorders. We also see clients with a range of other presenting issues as well, including depression, trauma, bipolar disorder, relationship issues, emotional and behavioral problems. We treat youth, adults, families and couples. We deliver individual and group treatment approaches. We also provide a wide range of psycho diagnostic assessments, including ADHD and ASD assessments for adults.

SA-PIC trains professionals to be skillful at serving individuals and families across the lifespan and to support systems through consultation and training. SA-PIC is comprised of two training sites. Alliance Psychology (Alliance) is a fee for service group private practice housing a community of rigorously trained clinicians in a stand-alone garden office building in San Antonio, TX. Alliance’s team consists of eight full-time and three part-time clinicians, composed of eight licensed psychologists, as well as one licensed professional counselor supervisor, one licensed clinical social worker supervisor, and one psychiatrist. Alliance is also home to clinical trainees from several local institutions where psychiatry residents and psychology practicum students train and provide lower fee services. Alliance’s mission is to improve lives by providing personalized integrative mental healthcare for the entire family and clinical training to professionals. Alliance provides outpatient services at every age and every stage of life through personalized and effective treatment modalities including individual, family, couples and group therapy. In addition, Alliance offers an array of psychological testing and psychiatric services. Alliance providers employ an integrative team approach to provide the highest quality of care possible.

Residents will have the opportunity to become knowledgeable in private practice operations and serve the community in a fee for service outpatient setting not constrained by third party payers or organizational demands. Residents will provide psychotherapy and psychological assessments in a thriving outpatient private practice. Psychotherapy approaches and modalities will be tailored to each patients unique needs and residents will have the opportunity to collaborate and/or provide co-therapy with other clinicians (including supervisors) on shared cases as clinically indicated. Psychological testing training opportunities will include comprehensive batteries with projectives (including the Rorschach) and Autism specific testing. Additionally, residents may have the opportunity to utilize psychological testing instruments for therapeutic purposes with intervention cases as clinically relevant. Lastly, Alliance has contracts with local institutions to provide services on site and residents may have the opportunity to provide services in conjunction with contracts. The Bexar County Juvenile Probation Department (BCJPD) is committed to building safe and healthy communities by strengthening children and families.

BCJPD provides a wide array of targeted effective behavioral health interventions including individual, family, and group therapy, as well as skills training, experiential learning, psychological testing and psychiatric services. BCJPD strives for all interventions to be evidence-informed and individualized to address the unique needs of the youth and their family within the context of their larger community. BCJPD also offers practicum and internship opportunities to students in clinical, social service, and justice-related educational programs.

The full Training Manual and more is available at our program’s website: https://counseling.buffalostate.edu/training-program The Buffalo State Doctoral Internship Program provides supervised experience in individual therapy, group counseling, crisis intervention, outreach programming, and consultation. Emphasis is on brief psychotherapy, including screening assessments, initial assessment interviews, group counseling, college developmental and educational issues, responding to trauma, and multiculturalism. The internship at Buffalo State is designed to provide supervised experiences in those activities which reflect the functioning of a psychologist in a college or university counseling center. Beyond the core competencies, we believe that training should be tailored to the individual experience and needs of each trainee. Clinicians at the center utilize interventions from a variety of theoretical orientations, including psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, multicultural, interpersonal, and humanistic. Thus, an intern has the opportunity to be exposed to a wide range of theories and interventions while developing their own individual therapeutic style. The Counseling Center staff is dedicated to the concept of excellence in a training experience within a multifaceted, service-oriented agency. While broad exposure to a variety of professional activities is advocated, a genuine commitment to intensive supervision and to the furthering of the intern’s personal and professional growth exists as the foundation of our philosophy. Overall, we seek to create an atmosphere of respect and trust where trainees and professional staff support their own and each other’s growth both personally and professionally. The overall goal of the SUNY Buffalo State University Counseling Center Internship in Health Psychology, in collaboration with “home” academic programs, is to produce professionals who are ready to embark on their next steps as early-career psychologists. To do this, we provide interns with structured and scaffolded training and experiences. As outlined by the APA Standards of Accreditation (SoA), the internship program is designed to prepare emerging psychologists in nine profession-wide competencies (PWC) (available here: https://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/standards-of-accreditation.pdf ) through related training and service delivery activities. Students must demonstrate competence in: Research Ethical and legal standards Individual and cultural diversity Professional values, attitudes, and behaviors Communication and interpersonal skills Assessment Intervention Supervision Consultation and interprofessional/interdisciplinary skills Each PWC is defined [in our training manual] within the context of the BSU Counseling Center, informing interns how these skills are taught and evaluated during the internship program. The expectations for the quantity of the intern’s work and the expectations for successful completion of the training program are described for each PWC and the work activities outlined in Part 2: Intern Schedule (e.g. Intern Seminars and Case Disposition meetings are weekly, Formal Case Presentations are semesterly, etc.). Interns’ work in each area should start at a quality appropriate to the high level of graduate training that one completes prior to internship (assessed via recommendation letters and Director of Clinical Training approval), but is expected to be variable based on previous experiences and growth opportunities. Interns are expected to be collaborative in defining growth goals, and remain open and responsive to training and feedback throughout their internship year, culminating in quality that is appropriate for embarking on their next steps as early-career psychologists.

Program Description The Arc of Central Alabama is a Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) agency that serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The Arc of Central Alabama doctoral internship program operates within the Behavior Support Department of the agency. The program offers interns training experience providing psychological services to adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities in their residences (i.e., group homes) and in the community via two major rotations and one minor rotation. BEHAVIOR SUPPORT (MAJOR ROTATION) Interns have the opportunity to provide applied behavior analytic services to individuals who reside in group homes in Jefferson County and individuals who attend the day program at The Arc’s main campus. Interns will provide direct services in clusters of group homes in the western part of Birmingham and in Centerpoint, Alabama, approximately twenty minutes north of The Arc’s main campus. Approximately 50 individuals reside across the group homes interns serve, providing extensive experience with individuals with various skills and presenting problems. Individuals who require Behavior Support services often present with intense externalizing behavior such as aggression toward others, property destruction, pica, self-injury, or elopement. Interns and clinical supervisors collaborate to develop behavior support plans to address presenting concerns. Interns build rapport with and train direct support staff in residential homes and the day program to implement Behavior Support Plans with fidelity to reduce the likelihood of challenging behavior and teach individuals functionally equivalent, adaptive replacement behavior (e.g., functional communication, engagement in leisure activities). Opportunities are available for interns to conduct Functional Behavior Assessments, develop Behavior Support Plans, teach functional communication, train staff to implement behavior reduction and skill acquisition programs, participate in support team meetings, and engage in interdisciplinary collaboration with psychiatry, nursing, and case management. PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES CLINIC (MAJOR ROTATION) Interns provide adapted behavioral therapy to individuals served by The Arc who do not currently receive behavioral therapy in the community. Opportunities to conduct brief psychological evaluations, especially for aging individuals who exhibit signs of cognitive decline, are also available as a part of this rotation. Common presenting concerns for individuals who receive behavioral therapy include anxiety, depression, a history of trauma, and interpersonal difficulties with peers, staff, or their employers. Interns and clinical supervisors collaborate to select appropriate evidence-based treatments depending on individuals’ presenting concerns and adapt treatments to individuals’ cognitive and behavioral skills. Individuals who receive behavioral therapy are typically verbally fluent people diagnosed with mild to moderate intellectual disability. Many of these individuals have a co-occurring diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder or an anxiety disorder. Interns are expected to initially engage in co-therapy with their supervisor and transition to independently managing one to two behavioral therapy cases by mid-year in this rotation. NEURODEVELOPMENT CENTER (MINOR ROTATION) Interns conduct comprehensive psychological evaluations at The Arc Neurodevelopment Center located in Birmingham, AL on The Arc's main campus. Interns collaborate with their supervisors to serve individuals across the lifespan (early childhood through adulthood) who demonstrate developmental differences and may meet criteria for a neurodevelopmental disability. Interns gain experience utilizing a variety of cognitive, developmental, social-emotional, and behavioral assessment tools to address individuals' and families' presenting concerns about development. Interns have the opportunity to participate in and lead initial intake interviews with individuals and their family members, complete psychological testing with a testing battery tailored to each individual, and provide diagnostic feedback and recommendations to individuals and their families.

Paid state and federal holidays, with ability to 'bank' worked holidays (these expire after 90 days). Brief description of the typical work day for an intern at this training site At the start of internship year, each intern will develop an individualized learning contract, in which they are assigned their primary inpatient training rotations for the year and select one to two elective training experiences (e.g., outpatient rotations, other rotations). After orientation is completed, interns begin their clinical work. We value work-life balance but also expect that interns will have some additional work outside of the 40-hour-week during certain periods, especially if doing a writing-heavy rotation. Each week throughout the year, the intern will dedicate 18 hours to their primary (core) rotation (i.e., an inpatient SMI rotation for interns in the General/SMI track, and a forensic rotation for interns in the Forensic track); 8-16 hours to additional training opportunities (e.g., elective rotations in other clinical areas of interest); 4 hours in didactics and group supervision; and 2 hours of flexible 'flex' time.

Program Description The University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School (UMass Chan) and Worcester Recovery Center and Hospital (WRCH) offer an APA-accredited doctoral internship in Clinical Psychology. Our overall focus is on the training of emerging psychologists in the public sector. Our mission is to provide learning experiences in the assessment of and intervention with individuals presenting with severe and persistent mental illness (SMI). We offer a variety of inpatient and outpatient rotations, and interns will be exposed to a broad range of ages, backgrounds, and types of psychopathology. We offer two tracks: a general SMI track and a forensic evaluation track. Rotations include inpatient experiences at WRCH, outpatient therapy (adults, children, and families), forensic evaluations, health psychology and adult consult-liaison, adolescent outpatient testing and treatment, addictions, primary care and family medicine, and neuropsychological testing. In addition to clinical rotations, interns will participate in a weekly didactic training seminar series, and the medical school holds grand rounds every week. Interns participate in individual, peer, and group supervision. The Internship trains students in nine profession-wide competencies, i.e., Research; Ethical and Legal Standards; Individual and Cultural Diversity; Professional Values, Attitudes, and Behaviors; Communication and interpersonal Skills; Assessment; Evidence-based interventions; Supervision; and Consultation and Interprofessional/Interdisciplinary Skills.

Program Description The University of Miami Counseling Center internship program utilizes a General Practitioner Training Model in providing a closely supervised training experience in intervention, assessment, and outreach/consultation within the context of working with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds and lifestyles. It is our aim that interns who successfully complete the program will have developed the fundamental skills and knowledge to launch professional careers as health service psychologists in a wide array of clinical settings, not limited to a university counseling center. Efforts are made with interns to individualize their training activities in view of their specialty areas and past experience. The availability of summer external rotations in several diverse clinical areas and the involvement in our program of clinical practitioners from the South Florida community facilitate a well-rounded training experience. In addition to individual supervision, the program offers eight ongoing seminars/case conferences during the fall and spring semesters. The theoretical orientation of the training staff can be described as eclectic. Since the program adheres to a General Practitioner Training Model, previous counseling center experience is not required and students from both clinical and counseling programs are encouraged to apply. In adherence to the profession wide competencies for doctoral Interns in health service psychology established by the American Psychological Association, our internship program facilitates achievement of competencies in the following domains: intervention, assessment, individual and cultural diversity, supervision, consultation and interprofessional / interdisciplinary skills, ethical and legal standards, professional values and attitudes, communication and interpersonal skills and research.

Program Description The intent of our doctoral internship in professional psychology is to provide a broadly based and integrated scholar-practitioner program for this capstone year of graduate training in clinical or counseling psychology. The application of psychological science, broadly defined, is at the foundation of developmentally sequenced experiential learning in multiple intervention modalities, and is supported by intensive supervision, seminar experiences, opportunities for role models and mentors, and a commitment to life-long learning. Our internship is designed to prepare ethical and multiculturally sensitive professional psychologists who can move with competence, creativity and flexibility into a variety of positions providing clinical, consultation and outreach services to adults in outpatient settings, and providing training to students and other clinicians. Self-reflection and interpersonal dialogue are highly valued aspects of our training. Supervisors and seminar facilitators encourage, but never require, self-disclosure of personal information that may facilitate or hinder psychological practice or collegial relationships. We value our multicultural, multidisciplinary and multitheoretical learning and working environment. Enhancement of multicultural skills is an important aspect of our program, with interns participating in a weekly multicultural seminar and staff actively engaged in examining our own multiple identities. Our staff and training program is multidisciplinary, involving clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, licensed professional counselors, and clinical social workers. The diverse theoretical approaches utilized by staff enrich our work while our shared awareness of developmental issues and of brief therapy provide common ground. Staff members are diverse in identities, therapeutic approaches, and academic discipline; we share a love of training and a focus on providing quality brief clinical services, outreach and consultation services to support the University of Michigan student communities. Various training seminars and supervision opportunities include UM Social Work interns, Post-Doctoral Fellows, Post-MSW Fellows and Psychology Practicum trainees.

The child program works with a wide group of clients in evidence-based assessment, parent, couples, and family treatments, individual interventions, and psychoeducational groups and community consultation; the adult program works with individuals, couples, and groups using a range of evidence-based therapeutic approaches, including CBT, ACT, DBT, Emotion Focused Therapy, Mindfulness based interventions, & integrative models. Both programs provide experience in test administration and ADHD/LD evaluations, with ASD testing also available. In addition to these core experiences throughout the year in outpatient psychotherapy and testing, interns also select specialized mini-training opportunities (up to 4 hrs/wk) among a variety of options including time to work on your own research, community outreach, school-based work, family-based wellness consultation and program development, early childhood mental health assessment, and supervision of junior trainees. These mini opportunities may last for a few months or throughout the training year. Clinical staff includes psychologists, social workers and a consulting psychiatrist. Training occurs in an interdisciplinary context that includes psychology practicum and social work students, MSW fellows, psychology postdoctoral fellows, and occasionally, psychiatry residents.

These are completed after the match. Failure to pass the background check places individuals at risk for not being eligible for the internship. Program Description We are committed to promoting interns' professional development in the APA's Health Service Psychology Profession-Wide Competence areas so as to prepare them for rewarding careers as psychologists in healthcare, academics, and other organizational settings. The aim of the internship is to prepare psychologists with the requisite knowledge and skills for post-internship career activities, entry to the profession, and into the practice of Health Service Psychology. By the conclusion of the internship, interns are expected to demonstrate competence in each of the Profession-Wide Competence areas. Interns generally pursue postdoctoral fellowships after the internship, some go on to postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Minnesota. We provide broad training in child psychology with a relative focus on psychological and neuropsychological assessment and strong psychotherapy training with diverse modalities (e.g., ACT, behavior thereapy, CBT, DBT, play therapy, trauma-focused therapy, parent training). Interns complete two 6-month rotations associated with two of the Medical School's departments: The Department of Pediatrics and the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. Rotations offered are: (a) Child & Adolescent Mental Health (formerly Child and Adolescenet Psychiatry); (b) Pediatric Neuropsychology; and (c) Pediatric Psychology. The internship has been APA-accredited since 1965, making it the 13th longest continuously accredited program in the country (60 years). Interns gain exposure to common and complex medical and neurological (e.g., cancer, diabetes, genetic disorders, FASD, transplant), developmental, and psychiatric patients from early childhood through adolescence, primarily outpatient. Intensive didactics and supervision are strengths of the internship. It is a clinically rich, stimulating setting with strong emphasis on quality assessment and improvement and excellent interprofessional collaborations. Didactics are generally child-focused and include: Assessment Seminar, Diversity Seminar, Psychotherapy Seminar, Topical Seminar and other training in Pediatrics and Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Departments. Interns participate in case conferences, multiple rounds, and work collaboratively with interdisciplinary teams. We also provide two workshops on supervision and on cultural diversity in conjunction with other local internships (through Minnesota APA-Accredited Psychology Internship Centers [MAAPIC]). Faculty are active, licensed doctoral clinicians involved in clinical, educational, research, administrative and professional activities who are committed to training and supervision. The internship provides excellent preparation for postdoctoral fellowships and licensure. The University of Minnesota Medical School has a postdoctoral fellowship in Pediatric Neuropsychology and Pediatric Psychology. Postdoctoral fellowships are also available some years in Child & Adolescent Mental Health. Interns get exposure to the psychiatric emergency room (Behavioral Emergency Center; BEC) EmPAth unit, and interprofessional education (IPE). Interns meet with their mentor monthly throughout the year. The outpatient child and adolescent mental health, pediatric and pediatric neuropsychology clinics provide an excellent training environment with several medical specialties ranked annually in US News and World Report Best Hospitals. Most internship activities are on the newly renovated campus of the Masonic Institute for the Developing Brain (MIDB; https://midb.umn.edu). Clinical training comprises a hybrid mixture of in-person and telehealth (using Amwell) services including psychotherapy and psychological assessment. Didactics and supervision are provided through a mixture of in-person and virtual activities. The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul consistently rank highly among American Cities in terms of quality of life, culture, education, affordability, environment, healthcare, bicycling, and more.

Please see the UMMC Faculty and Staff Handbook for further information. https://www.umc.edu/common/files/institutional%20files/facultystaffhandbook.pdf Program Description The UMMC Psychology Residency Program endorses a cognitive-behavioral orientation within a scientist-practitioner model. Interest in, and experience with, this approach are important selection criteria. Interns gain clinical experience with a wide variety of patient populations and across multiple settings through inpatient, outpatient, and community placements. Although clinical training activities play a paramount role in our program, interns are expected to maintain active involvement in research. Continuing education seminars, grant writing seminar, dissemination and implementation curriculum, and professional development didactics comprise an additional important component of training. The internship year is divided into 3 four-month rotations. A variety clinical rotations are available (See Rotations below), each serving different populations and providing unique services. Rotation assignments are made based on interns’ rankings and Training Program faculty input based on intern’s training needs and clinical goals as well as program needs. At least 2 of 3 rotation assignments will be within interns’ top 5 rankings. Interns provide rankings twice during the year, prior to the start of internship and in September, to allow for experiences with the first rotation to be considered before making choices for the second and third rotations. Rotations are divided into Child and Adult emphasis areas. Interns are encouraged to gain experiences within both emphasis areas. Clinical supervision and training are conducted on a one-on-one and small group basis. Additional clinical opportunities occur through the General Psychology Clinic, where interns gain experience working with longer-term outpatient cases and can receive supervision from psychology faculty other than their rotation supervisors. Interns are expected to accumulate at least 500 face-to-face clinical hours during the internship year. A unique aspect of clinical experiences offered through the program includes the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of patient populations served at UMMC. The UMMC Psychology Internship Training Program currently has 7 internship slots, with about half of the slots having an adult emphasis and half having a child emphasis. Child-Focused Rotations : Center for Advancement of Youth (CAY) Pediatric Psychology Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Child Inpatient Adult-Focused Rotations : Administrative Mini Rotation Adult Inpatient Center for Innovation and Discovery in Addictions (CIDA) Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Integrative Health Trauma and Dual Disorders Methodist Rehabilitation Neuropsychology/Behavioral Medicine Neuropsychology There are opportunities to provide services through telehealth in the General Psychology Clinic and on the clinical rotations. However, additional opportunities for teleheatlh vary by rotation. For more information, please see our program website and brochure, and email the Training Director for additional information.

Twenty additional leave days (sick plus vacation) plus 5 professional development days for dissertation, job search, etc. This is 38 days off for one year of employment! Additionally, we typically have work from home options during break weeks (e.g., Thanksgiving, winter intersession, Spring Break, May intersession, etc.) and during the summer. Interns use vacation for the final week of internship so end 51 weeks after the start date but are expected to work that final (51st) week (i.e., cannot take vacation to leave internship earlier). Brief description of the typical work day for an intern at this training site One of the great things about working at a counseling center is that it is challenging to describe a typical day -- there is so much variety! Interns will often see clients, do outreach, provide supervision, receive supervision, attend meetings, complete paperwork, attend seminars - including the year-long bimonthly multicultural integration seminar, and socialize with other staff members, perhaps by walking to a nearby coffee shop all within the same day. Other days provide other opportunities such as doing group, completing new evaluations, consulting with university community members, providing crisis intervention, reading up on new therapy approaches, attending intern support group lunch, and reviewing session video. Our office is quite social, so there are ample opportunities through each week for casual interactions with many staff members. Our location in the heart of a beautiful campus near walking trails, green space, and restaurants make quick self-care breaks out of the office very feasible during a typical lunch hour! We highly value work-life balance, and the office is usually quite deserted by 5:00. While we work hard during the day, we prize our lives outside of work and make sure interns are able to do so, as well. Self-care is modeled from the top down and manifested in myriad ways.

Zoom interviews will be conducted in late December and early January. Zoom interviews are approximately 45 minutes in length and consist of standardized questions as well as a time for questions from the applicant. Questions cover a variety of topics and are designed to get to know each applicant on a personal level and assess for fit with our site. While interviews are inherently stressful, we work hard to make this a pleasant process for all involved. Following another review, the Training Director will conduct brief, follow-up Zoom interviews in mid-January with all applicants still under consideration. These conversations provide a less formal opportunity to get final questions answered and have a chance to visit with the Training Director. Applicants will be contacted via email to schedule these interviews, as well. Following a final discussion of candidates by the selection committee, we will submit our rank list to NMS. Applicants are encouraged to contact current interns at any time in the process to solicit first hand information regarding our training program. Applicants will also have an opportunity to participate in a virtual open house with current interns at some point in the selection process (prior to ranks being due). Questions about the application or selection process should be directed to the Training Director, Dr. Jenny Lybeck-Brown.

Our Developmental-Apprentice-Practitioner (DAP) model emphasizes purposeful, developmental, challenging, hands-on experiences with mentorship and increasing autonomy throughout the year. We view our interns as colleagues and enjoy getting to know them as individuals. We value diversity and incorporate it into all aspects of training. Furthermore, diversity is reflected in the clients seen at our agency with a large non-traditional population of varying racial and ethnic backgrounds, and social identities who are in undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs (e.g., law, medical, dental, pharmacy). While many students do present with developmental concerns, our clients often present with significant mental health issues. Interns engage in the delivery of traditional counseling services in an urban university setting including individual, and group therapy as well as outreach and consultation. In addition, interns participate in year-long seminars and direct experience in multiculturalism and supervision of trainees. Our model allows our interns the flexibility to individualize their experience through special focus rotations each semester; examples include administration, outreach, or special populations. Please visit our website for a complete program description. The UMKC Counseling Services uses the APPIC Application for Psychology Internship Form. Included should be three letters of reference (must be from individuals with direct knowledge of your academic and clinical performance), and they should use the APPIC Standardized Reference Form.

Program Description CAPS is part of the Student Wellness unit, which embraces balanced, holistic health and wellness. The UNLV CAPS Doctoral Internship in Health Service Psychology is designed to train interns to be competent, entry-level generalist psychologists. The internship training program emphasizes professional identity development, ethical decision making, and multicultural competence. CAPS provides a setting in which interns increase and strengthen their abilities to practice psychology throughout their year. Interns successfully complete their internship when they reach a skill level of intermediate to advanced competence practice defined by having sufficient ability to practice core skills without ongoing supervision. Training involves developing both core skills and positive professional identity essential for the work of an entry-level psychologist. Interns work with a multidisciplinary staff who offer diverse backgrounds and various theoretical orientations, including evidence-based treatment. Interns have the opportunity to work within a university counseling center that is part of a larger Student Wellness unit committed to integrated care. This collaborative setting includes partnerships with the Student Health Center, Disability Resource Center, Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, CARE Center, Wellness Promotions, and the University Support Team. Interns gain valuable experience working alongside a diverse range of professionals—including health care providers, care advocates, psychiatrists, and psychiatric residents—in a multidisciplinary environment that supports holistic and coordinated care for students. Interns gain experience by participating in a wide range of supervised professional activities within a large, urban, diverse university counseling center, including: Individual, relationship (couples), and group therapy from a brief treatment model. Crisis assessment and intervention. Assessment and diagnosis. Individual and group supervision. Didactic Seminars (Multicultural, Case Conference, Clinical Issues Seminar, Teaching Life Long Learning and Competency, and Supervision of Supervision). Provision of supervision. Case management and referrals to community mental health care. Outreach, educational workshops and presentations, and consultation across the university. Research, training, professional development, and other activities. Optional emphasis areas including, but not limited to: Behavioral Health, Anxiety, Substance Use Disorders, LGBTQ+, Trauma, and Sport Psychology.

These services are undertaken in accordance with the following mission – the mission of Counseling Services is to provide personalized culturally-responsive mental health services, training, and outreach to the University community. By doing so, we promote an inclusive learning environment supportive of mental health, diversity and social justice, as well as student personal growth and academic success. The professional clinical staff currently consists of nine full-time psychologists, one part-time psychologist, three full-time licensed clinical social workers, and one licensed alcohol and drug counselor, in addition to several administrative staff. Each year we have an average of 10 trainees in psychology, social work, marriage and family therapy, or clinical mental health counseling from the practicum to post-masters or post-doctoral level. Our doctoral internship is designed to train interns to be competent entry level generalist health service psychologists, especially in college or university counseling settings. We have several specific objectives within this overarching goal: 1) Clinical Competence, 2) Multicultural Responsive Practice and Humility, and 3) Ethical Practice and Professionalism. 1) We strive to train entry-level generalists who are committed to providing competent psychological services, including initial evaluation/assessment, individual and group psychotherapy, psychological testing, multicultural practice, supervision of trainees (depending on number of available practicum students), and program evaluation and research in multi-disciplinary environments. In addition, we strive to train generalists with competence to work in an identified emphasis area including, but not limited to, diversity and multicultural counseling, psychological testing, sport psychology consulting, group counseling, DBT, or outcome evaluation and research (emphasis areas offerings are dependent of supervisory resources year to year). 2) We strive to train generalists who are invested in life-long development of multicultural competence, who apply ongoing self-awareness as cultural beings, awareness of others as cultural beings, and awareness of interactions among themselves, others, and groups within systems to maintain culturally-informed practice and multicultural humility. 3) We strive to train generalists to conduct themselves in a socially and ethically responsible manner, understanding and applying the laws and ethical principles of psychology as a profession. We value self-reflection, self-assessment, and self-care. We strive to train generalists who identify, reflect about, understand, and promote socially-just change at the individual client, group, institutional, community, and systems level, particularly when it impacts client development and functioning. The University of Nevada, Reno Counseling Services seeks individuals who are team players, have a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion, have solid communication skills, balance good self-care with effective practice, are open to learning, and value self-reflection as a tool for professional development. The internship is an on-site experience. Informational brochure available upon request.

Other Requirements: Program Description We offer a comprehensive training experience in health service psychology for interns working toward doctoral degrees in counseling or clinical psychology. The internship program provides supervision in individual and group therapy, crisis intervention, outreach and consultation, supervision, administration, and program development. Members of the professional staff represent various theoretical orientations and provide numerous opportunities for supervision. Interns receive a minimum of two hours of individual supervision and two hours of group supervision weekly as well as participate in specialized training seminars, which complement the intern's clinical experience. Interns are highly valued members of the professional staff and are expected to participate in the business and staff development activities. While each staff person maintains their own theoretical orientation, all staff value and acknowledge the importance of relationship in all aspects of their work. The supervisor/mentor serves to facilitate the learning of clinical and therapeutic skills, and advancement in psychology as a profession. During the first few weeks of internship, interns and supervisors share tasks such as intake and emergency coverage, with interns assuming more responsibility and autonomy as they are ready.

Program Description T he clinical psychology internship at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center has 7 tracks with emphasis in: Clinical Child; Integrated Behavioral Health; Early Childhood; Autism Spectrum Disorders, Multicultural Rural and Native American Behavioral Health; Pediatric Neuropsychology; and Substance USe Disorders and Addictions. All tracks share a training philosophy that is multicultural, developmental, contextual and interdisciplinary. Treatment settings include inpatient, outpatient, and community. We serve a highly diverse population of adults, children, adolescents, and families in the public sector, many with a history of trauma. The program has adopted a model of Evidence Based Practice in which contextual factors are keenly considered, and the therapist is culturally responsive. This model assumes that culture, regardless of ethnicity, is a central aspect that must be considered in all types of psychological intervention. In addressing cultural responsiveness, the program emphasizes both process and outcome and focuses as much on the provider as it does on the patient. Specific knowledge and skills are not seen as sufficient to training culturally and developmentally responsive psychologists. Cultural responsiveness is a reflective practice and a lifelong process. To train psychologists in evidence-based practice that will be appropriate for diverse populations, the program fosters an open, collaborative and multidimensional perspective while encouraging the analytic skills required for effective decision-making. In addition to providing training in traditional treatment approaches (e.g. CBT, behavioral, DBT Informed, and psychodynamic) the program promotes contextual models, such as family systems, because these models are conducive to viewing culture as an integral feature to be addressed in clinical practice. The program facilitates Interns' examination of how their culture (as experienced in their families and academic environments) has influenced them (who they are, how they see themselves, what they value in others, etc).

Interns will have opportunities to work closely with a large and diverse multidisciplinary team of psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists, and nurse practitioners with a wide range of theoretical orientations (including interpersonal, cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, feminist, integrative, etc) and areas of professional interest/pecialization (such as working with BIPOC students, gender issues, LGBTQ identities and communities, first generation college students, disordered eating, sexual and relationship trauma, spirituality, mindfulness, grief, suicide prevention, career development, and crisis intervention). Interns will participate in didactic seminars, staff meetings, and staff professional continuing education programs. Interns will engage in a year-long multicultural mentoring experience and will be expected to actively participate in activities designed to increase multicultural awareness, knowledge, and skills and to work with clients of diverse identities and experiences. Supervision is an important skill to develop as an early career therapist. A unique aspect of the UNC-CH CAPS internship is having the opportunity to supervise a practicum student for at least one semester and participate in supervision of supervision year-long. These sup of sup sessions provide a theoretical and conceptual framework for supervision, a format to receive feedback and increase awareness of their own supervision styles and an opportunity to develop supervisory skills and technique. CAPS' internship program values self-reflection, life-long learning, openness to diverse perspectives, and learning from one another as staff and as trainees. Twice-monthly meetings with the Director of Training/Coordinator of Training focus on checking in with each intern on their goals for learning and development, as well as exploring their professional identities, job search, self-care, and transition from intern to professional. Staff and interns are working in-person at CAPS, providing predominantly in-person services with some tele-therapy services. Training activities are currently being conducted either in-person or via Zoom. Interns have received training in telehealth services during orientation since 2020, and we will continue to provide training in telehealth during future orientations.

Information about background check requirement may be found here: https://campus.und.edu/human-resources/managers-toolbox/e-verify.html Program Description The UND University Counseling Center (UCC) Doctoral Internship Program utilizes a General Practitioner Training Model to provide a high-quality training experience to 2 doctoral interns in individual and group psychotherapy, crisis intervention, diagnostics and psychological assessment, substance use assessment and intervention, supervision provision, consultation, and outreach and programming development, with the scaffolding and support of licensed supervisors and skilled staff. It is our aim to train and develop culturally responsive and competent entry-level psychologists skilled in the profession-wide competences to serve a diverse public in various settings, including and beyond, a university counseling center. Evidence-based practice, science, and research are all important foundations that inform the UCC’s services and training program, with careful attention to APA-established competencies in ethical and legal standards, intervention, assessment, supervision, individual and cultural diversity, professional values and attitudes, communication and interpersonal skills, consultation and inter-professional/interdisciplinary skills, and research. Services at the UCC are provided to the UND student population and to faculty and staff in support of student wellness. Most students are from North Dakota and Minnesota, making up 59% of the student population. Nearly equal amounts of men and women attend UND and 25% of students report non-white race/ethnicity. A wide range of diagnostic concerns and presentations are accounted for within our center and provide the opportunity to develop the skills of a general practitioner. In addition, unique characteristics of our student population, such as those in the aviation field of study, and students from rural communities, allow for the development of nuanced skill sets. Interns are provided with their own offices within the UCC and a $40,000 stipend for the year, as well as applicable benefits, allowing for a comfortable standard of living in Grand Forks, North Dakota. UND is the only university in the country that is home to a medical school, law school, and schools of aviation and aerospace science, affording interns the unique opportunity to provide services to these specific populations and gain specialized skills in mind-body medicine; case conference, grand rounds, and didactics with the UND School of Medicine and Health Sciences/Dept. of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science; and aviation counseling and assessment. Interns receive weekly individual supervision, group supervision, supervision of supervision, assessment supervision, didactics and training seminar, staffing and case conference, bi-weekly integrated staffing with Student Health Services, monthly meetings with the training director and bi-weekly meetings with the internship program director to maximize interns' personal and professional development. Special attention is also provided to interns’ specific interests, skill sets, and professional goals. Upon hire, interns will be required to complete a background check as part of standard UND hiring procedures ( https://campus.und.edu/human-resources/_files/docs/chbc/chbc-form-hw-edits.pdf ).

The UNF Counseling Center is centrally located on campus and features 23 counseling offices, 2 group therapy rooms with recording capabilities, a conference room with audiovisual technology, a private waiting area, a dedicated psychological testing room, a break room with kitchen amenities, and a quiet space for clients who are in distress or who lack a confidential space to attend remote sessions. Interns are each assigned a private, fully furnished office equipped with a desktop computer, secure internet access, and sound attenuation for confidentiality. Offices are suitable for both clinical and administrative work, and interns are encouraged to personalize their space. Interns also enjoy access to campus amenities, including the Student Wellness Complex and the on-campus nature preserve. UNF’s campus includes a nature preserve, with walking trails, a lake, and equipment for recreational water activities. Interns also have access to administrative staff, who provide essential support to staff and trainees. These staff members work directly with clients in the reception area and are responsible for checking in clients, answering phones, managing client data, and assisting with scheduling. Brief description of the typical work day for an intern at this training site Interns work a 40-hour week for the entire duration of their internship. During the first semester of internship, they are expected to work five eight-hour days (Monday – Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM with a one-hour lunch). This aligns with the Center’s hours of operation. During the second and third semesters, interns can retain this schedule or embrace an alternate schedule in which they work for nine hours per day (either 7:30 AM – 5:00 PM or 8:00 AM – 5:30 PM) with a half-hour lunch for four days of the week and one four-hour day. For example, an intern may work from 7:30 AM to 5:00 PM on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and from 7:30-11:30 AM on Thursdays. Daily schedules vary across semesters and between interns. Despite the variability, each day typically includes the provision of various clinical services, administrative time, and supervision or training activities. Due to the flexible nature of daily schedules, it may be more helpful to describe an intern’s typical week. Interns spend anywhere from 10 to 15 hours per week on administrative tasks (e.g., paperwork). They receive at least 2 hours of face-to-face, individual supervision with their primary supervisor, 1 hour of group supervision for the doctoral intern cohort, 1 hour of group supervision for early career professionals, and 2 hours of professional development time. Interns attend a weekly Training Seminar, which typically takes place on Monday mornings and lasts 2.5 hours. They also attend Assessment Seminar, Supervision of Supervision, and Supervision of Groups on a biweekly basis and meet individually with the Training Director for an hour each month. Interns provide roughly 16 hours of clinical services each week during Fall and Spring. During the Summer, interns schedule the same number of hours, knowing that some of those hours will not be filled due to reduced student demand. Their weekly direct hours include intake assessments (1.5 hours), group counseling (1.5 hours), crisis counseling (2 hours), and individual therapy (11 hours). When interns participate in outreach events, administer psychological assessments, or provide supplemental supervision to a Master’s intern, they reduce the individual clients they see that week to accommodate. Interns complete two psychological assessment cases (Fall and Spring), provide one hour of supplemental supervision biweekly to Master’s level trainees (Spring and Summer), and participate in outreach activities as desired.

Program Description The UNF Counseling Center’s doctoral internship program offers a one-year, full-time training experience within a multidisciplinary university counseling center. Grounded in the practitioner-scholar model, our program emphasizes the integration of psychological theory and empirical evidence in clinical practice. This generalist training program is designed to help interns develop proficiency across nine profession-wide competencies: research, ethical and legal standards, individual and cultural diversity, professionalism, communication and interpersonal skills, assessment, intervention, supervision, and consultation and interprofessional/interdisciplinary skills. Our primary goal is to support interns in their transition from graduate student to independently practicing psychologist. This journey is both exciting and challenging, and we aim to surround it with support, care, and respect—not only for interns as clinicians, but as people. We foster an environment where interns are encouraged to “rise to the occasion” professionally, while also receiving the guidance and compassion needed to navigate this pivotal year. We believe the work psychologists do holds deep value for individuals, communities, and society. It is a privilege to engage in this meaningful work, and we honor that privilege by striving for excellence. We view self-awareness and authenticity as essential components of professional competence and the therapeutic process. As such, we encourage curiosity, reflection, and openness in our interns and model these values in our training approach. Throughout the internship year, interns are given opportunities to consolidate and integrate the lessons learned during graduate school as they prepare to close one chapter and begin the next in their professional journey. Our training staff are committed to creating a safe and supportive environment that promotes growth through reflective and reflexive practice. Interns are expected to bring a spirit of curiosity, authenticity, and a commitment to personal and professional development.

Program Description It is with both sadness and hope that the UNC Counseling Center has made the determination to continue to remain inactive during the 2025-26 internship year Match process due to unforeseen circumstances that has impacted known/anticipated staffing patterns for the upcoming internship year. For those who have expressed interest in our program, we extend our most humble apologies as well as gratitude for your interest in our training program and the community we serve. We are actively in communication with APA, APPIC, and NMS during this process in an effort to maintain our ""accredited, inactive"" status for the 2025-26 training year. That said, we are hopeful that our site will be better positioned so as to be able to participate in the Match process next fall for the 2026-27 training year. Once that is known/officially sanctioned, we will be sure to update this section accordingly. Our Doctoral Internship in Health Service Psychology is designed to provide broad-based generalist training in activities carried out by psychologists in a university counseling center. Interns will develop competence in individual & group therapy; intake assessment; provision of supervision; crisis intervention; outreach; personality assessment; and ethical and multicultural practice. Our philosophy of training incorporates a developmental-apprenticeship perspective that combines mentorship and experiential learning to foster increasing autonomy. Overall, we seek to create an atmosphere of respect and trust where interns and professional staff support each others' growth. Diversity is celebrated and integrated into all aspects of training. Staff members utilize a variety of theoretical orientations, including interpersonal, feminist, existential-humanistic, systems, cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, mindfulness-based, etc. We recognize that each intern brings a variety of skills, experience, and training needs to the internship and that some flexibility is necessary for optimal growth. This is accomplished by providing individualized supervision goals, customized outreach and consultation projects, opportunities for special interest areas, and intern input for various seminars and activities. We see the internship year as a critical transition period. We seek to assist in this developmental process by providing interns opportunities to stretch, take risks, and try out different interventions and approaches. Interns are expected to develop greater proficiency in delivering evidence-based interventions. Furthermore, interns will develop and hone greater sensitivity to, and respect for, the multicultural world in which we exist. We are looking for flexible, motivated, open individuals who want to learn and grow, and who are passionate about providing services to the college population. We seek applicants whose career goals involve working in a university setting and who have at least 100 hours of individual therapy experience specifically with the adult population. Limited after-hours and weekend work are required (and for which, flex time is offered).

Program Description The internship program strives to train interns as Health Service Providers in the profession-wide competencies developed by the American Psychological Association, with a special emphasis on the skills, behaviors, and attitudes of a psychologist working in the context of a university counseling center. These include: ethical and legal standards, professional values and attitudes, research, individual and cultural diversity, assessment, evidence-based intervention, communication and interpersonal skills, interprofessional/interdisciplinary consultation, and supervision as well as an additional competency in outreach and consultation. Interns will also develop competency in up to two training exposure areas (one in the fall and one in the spring semester).Currently, these include acceptance and commmitment therapy, crisis intervention, grief and loss, emotion-focused therapy, Spanish-language therapy, sport psychology and substance use. The program has a dual focus on both clinical training and professional growth. It is expected that interns will make significant developmental transitions during the internship year, including consolidation of a professional identity, enhanced confidence in skills, and increased ability to function autonomously. The training program recognizes the inherent stress that accompanies these transitions. It is designed to provide activities, procedures, and opportunities that facilitate optimal professional growth while remaining sensitive to the challenges of that growth.

Degree Accepted Ed.D. Degree Accepted This institution, department, internship, or postdoctoral program requires trainees to sign a statement about personal behavior and/or religious beliefs as a condition of admission and/or retention in the program: No How to obtain text of statement: N/A Other Requirements: Within the OU Athletics Department culture, it is common for staff members to share their cell phone number with student-athletes. Within the PROS department, this exchange of numbers is used primarily to facilitate effective communication regarding appointment logistics and non-confidential information. All PROS clients sign an informed consent form that makes it clear such text and/or phone communication are only to be used for scheduling purposes and not for therapeutic content. OU PROS interns are encouraged to use their personal and professional discretion to determine if this practice is a fit for them and, if so, directions for how to encrypt their personal cell phone are provided by Athletics Information Technology personnel. If interns are not comfortable sharing their personal phone number with student-athletes or coaches, other mechanisms of communication are readily available (e.g., email, the Teamworks app). Please note that due to HIPAA regulations, Google Voice is not an option for secure communication with clients, and the department currently does not utilize other secure communication modalities outside of text, email, and Teamworks. Additionally, many of the OU teams use practice facilities that require a short drive (i.e., less than five minutes) to get to/from the PROS office in the OU football stadium. Should an intern not have access to a car for personal use, there are other options that are available to them: including carpooling with other staff members when possible, the OU campus bus system, or being assigned to the teams that are within walking distance from the PROS offices (e.g., track & field, wrestling, volleyball). Interns are also responsible for paying for their own parking pass for the internship year. OU Parking and Transportation Services charges OU employees (of which interns are included) $326 for one year of parking, which can be automatically deducted from their monthly salary at a rate of approximately $27/month. The OU campus is also a major hub for public transportation stops or other free ride-sharing options for students and staff. Please see the ""How to Apply"" document found on our website (https://soonersports.com/documents/2025/7/30/OU_PROS_How_to_Apply.pdf), which states that candidates who match with our training program must complete a background check. Final hiring for internship is contingent on clearing this step. Interns must also provide proof of individual professional liability insurance at the start of internship with coverage extending through the duration of the internship year Program Description The overarching aim of the training program within the University of Oklahoma Department of Athletics, Psychological Resources for OU Student-Athletes (OU PROS) is to train competent and ethical health service psychology professionals with emphasis on evolving in their awareness of intersectional multiculturalism, being well-rounded in their clinical skills, and growing in their sense of self as emerging practitioners. A secondary target of OU PROS is to assist interns in developing the necessary clinical skills to provide psychological testing and counseling to emerging adults who also participate in collegiate sport. Graduates of OU PROS training program are qualified to work within collegiate athletic departments, university counseling centers, and/or private practice settings serving both the general and athlete populations. Psychological Resources for OU Student-Athletes (PROS) is a mental health counseling center embedded in the University of Oklahoma (OU) Athletics Department. OU is a busy and dynamic National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I institution with an array of opportunities for working with student-athletes. As integral members of the OU student-athletes support team, interns become acquainted with the day-to-day functioning of OU Athletics and provide mental health, performance excellence, and psychological testing services to OU student-athletes. This setting also allows ample opportunity for interns to work in conjunction with academic advisors, athletic medicine staff, and athletics administrators to facilitate and support the overall wellness and holistic success of OU student-athletes. OU PROS is a full-time training program with a minimum of 40-hours per week that begins on July 15 th each summer and ends on July 14 th the following year. Interns will function under the formal title of “doctoral interns” and are eligible for OU health insurance and benefits, except for retirement (which is an OU HR policy exception pertaining to psychological interns). It is expected that doctoral interns will accrue 2,000 hours of supervised professional experience within this 12-month time frame to fulfill the American Psychological Association’s Commission on Accreditation and Oklahoma state requirements for licensure as a health service psychologist. For financial assistance, each intern will be paid $30,000 for the internship year, as well as $1,000 in professional development funds to be used towards conference attendance, pending budget availability in the OU Athletics Department. As full-time employees of the University of Oklahoma, interns can also accrue 27 days of “paid time off” (i.e., 18 hours per month) that can be used for sick time and vacation leave, as well as 14 paid university holidays during the training year. Five days (40 total hours) of additional professional leave can be used for attending state, regional, or national psychology conventions, to obtain additional professional training, attend their dissertation defense, and/or interview for job or postdoctoral fellow positions.

Program Description The aim of our internship program is to provide training opportunities that allow trainees to meet the competencies to practice Health Service Psychology at the entry level of independent practice. To this end, our program provides supervised clinical experience, supervision, and didactic experiences, consistent with our program Aims, Goals and Competencies. Although internship is primarily focused on clinical activities, we follow the scientist practitioner model, as science provides the basis for our clinical practice. Many of our faculty are involved in research and scholarly projects. All faculty practice evidence-based assessments and treatments. The core of the Intern's training is the clinical activities on the various rotations and each intern will be active in a wide range of clinical activities. Our program is a Generalist Internship, as interns receive experiences in intervention, consultation, and assessment during the internship year. A Generalist Internship is also defined as having experience with a range of clients across ages, genders and socio-economic/cultural groups. The major aim is to prepare interns for the practice of professional psychology. The rotation choices an intern makes allow for a concentrated emphasis in Pediatric Psychology, Child Clinical Psychology, Integrated Behavioral Health, or Clinical Neuropsychology while maintaining a Generalist Internship philosophy. Clinical experiential training consists of 3 major rotations of 4 months duration, each involves 24 hours of clinical work each week and 3 minor rotations of 4 months duration, which involve 12 hours of clinical activity each week. Internship-wide didactics are offered in each of the nine profession wide competencies. Many rotation specific didactics are offered as well. Interns receive a minimum of 4 hours of regularly scheduled face-to-face individual supervision each week. The program is devoted to training interns to meet competencies to practice as a Health Service Psychologist. Faculty value their teaching and supervision activities. Our program is located on the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center campus, as part of the OU Health Medical Center. We are a fully accredited APA Internship.

Program Description The Training Program at the University of Puerto Rico Internship Consortium is one-year full-time exclusively affiliated internship program for five (5) Ph.D. students emphasizing clinical psychology at the University of Puerto Rico.The Consortium consists of 4 major training sites: The University Center for Psychological Services and Research (CUSEP), the Institute of Psychological Research (IPsi), the Institute of Developmental Disabilities (IDDPR-PRUCEDD), and the Psychological Services Unit of the Dock Workers Wellness Plan (UTM-PRSSA). Our internship program offers a variety of experiences with the purpose of helping to continue developing the necessary skills to be a highly competent and ethical professional in the provision of psychological services and research, within a diverse context. Training opportunities for students are broad in range and involve psychotherapy in individual, couples, and family therapy, intake, crisis intervention, and training in various forms such as outreach, consultation, community workshops, and assessment including developmental, psychological, cognitive, neuropsychological, psycho-educational, and personality. Multiple theoretical orientations are represented among the supervisors, including behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, systemic, psychodynamic, psychoanalytic, and trauma-focused interventions. Interns must complete at least 2000 contact hours. The consortium is structured to provide an in-depth, immersive experience at one agency which should be congruent with the intern’s primary interest area and corresponds to the intern’s primary placement. This is where the intern will spend most of their time. The intern will also have substantive training experience in a secondary placement within the Consortium. According to how the experience is designed, all interns must rotate one day of the week for the 12 month duration of the program. This allows for the strengthening of areas of weakness in the intern’s past training experience. Most of the time will be used to provide direct clinical services, clinical documentation, clinical supervision, and consultation with other providers. Interns will also be able to develop supervision skills by meeting regularly with practicum students to facilitate his/her professional development, train them in the process of intake interviews, and practice supervision skills in the process of intake interviews. Remaining time is dedicated to other activities related to training, like attending didactics and case conference meetings, peer consultation, scheduled meetings, providing workshops, doing research and literature review, and other indirect service activities.

We use an apprenticeship model that promotes the professional growth of the intern with the goal of enabling the intern to competently function in doctoral level positions in psychology upon graduation. To this end, the internship program employs a structured experiential model with exposure to gradually increasing levels of professional responsibility. As an APA accredited internship, we provide experiences designed to increase competencies in assessment, intervention, supervision, consultation within health services and to the university community, communication, research, ethics, individual and cultural difference, and self-reflection. The training experience is supported by intensive supervision, seminars, and clinical case conferences. These experiences include completing intake assessments and planning for appropriate disposition, provision of time-limited process-oriented informed psychotherapy, year-long interpersonal process group psychotherapy, short term skills based group therapy (e.g., DBT, CBT), on-call/emergency services, provision of supervision to graduate students in psychology, a group research project, and campus consultation and education. A significant strength of the program lies in the intern's opportunity to work closely and intensively with a multidisciplinary team of licensed clinicians. On a weekly basis interns receive 3 hours of individual supervision and 2 hours of group therapy supervision, participate in several case-based seminars, a supervision of supervision seminar, and a clinical case conference where senior staff present their work. Additional supervision is available as needed. The variety of theoretical approaches utilized by staff enrich our work while our orientation toward self-reflection and intentionality provides common ground.

Our program is grounded in a practitioner-scholar framework and set within a vibrant academic medical center that emphasizes interprofessional collaboration and evidence-based care. We feature tracks in Adult or Child and Adolescent Psychology. Within the adult track, subspecialty opportunities include working with individuals with serious mental illness (SPI), health psychology, Deaf and Hard of Hearing populations, Spanish-speaking patients and older adults. Set within the home of the biopsychosocial model, this predominantly clinical internship provides training in a variety of interdisciplinary settings with individuals with a wide range of presenting concerns. Our program offers multiple integrated care experiences where interns provide assessment, intervention, consultation, and supervision/teaching. We provide opportunities for trainees to work across the continuum of care, with rotations in inpatient and outpatient environments. Beyond direct clinical work, interns engage in a mentored program development or evaluation project that highlights the wide-reaching roles psychologists can play in systems-level change, administration, and academic leadership. This project allows interns to broaden their understanding of psychological practice and to contribute meaningfully to the institution at a systems level. Interns have an opportunity to present their work to their interdisciplinary faculty and colleagues within the Department of Psychiatry at the end of the academic year. Our program places a strong emphasis on training, supervision, and professional development. A robust didactic curriculum supports interns in developing their clinical identity and preparing for postdoctoral and early-career transitions. We are equally committed to fostering self-reflection, growth, and helping interns find their voice in the process. As a program, we continuously examine our own blind spots and actively work to address systemic and historical barriers to mental health care. Our training is guided by the ethical principles of psychology and a commitment to justice-informed practice. We are proud of the breadth, depth, and integrity of the training we offer, and we look forward to supporting the next generation of psychologists as they launch their careers.

Critical thinking, thorough assessment, and appreciation for diversity, equity and inclusion as well as cultural humility are hallmarks of our services. An understanding of the impact of culture is integrated into every aspect of the work we do in direct services, training and scholarly activity. We define culture and diversity broadly, allowing our definition to encompass race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual identity, socioeconomic status, nationality, acculturation, religious and spiritual beliefs, physical and mental abilities, size and appearance. To facilitate cultural competency and explore and challenge implicit biases, our Mental and Behavioral Health Team meets monthly for Health Accessibility meetings and interns are regularly included in this experience as participants and co-facilitators. The program provides initial self-assessment and close supervision utilizing aspects of developmental and competency based approaches. Independent thinking and self-appraisal are fostered. We offer generalist training in a university setting. Short-term services and outreach are emphasized. Cultural competency is promoted through seminars, experiential exercises, and supervision. In addition to generalist training, we encourage interns to develop interests through Clinical Focus Areas. The internship focuses on the profession-wide competencies stipulated by the APA Standards of Accreditation. Competencies attained and specifics regarding training experiences are detailed on our website. Telebehavioral health for clinical services and training will be utilized throughout the training year as needed.

We offer an outstanding training program in professional psychology within a large, urban academic medical center. The program is designed to offer two full-time, 12-month doctoral internship positions beginning the second week of August, providing 2,000 hours of professional training. Interns receive a $28,352.00 stipend over 12 months. We embrace a Scientist-Practitioner Model of education wherein interns follow a set of established methods for producing data to undergird the practice of professional psychology. As such, interns will utilize data-driven methods to provide high-quality assessments, interventions, and progress monitoring across a variety of clinical and community settings. The USF Department of Pediatrics is a large academic medical center whose mission is to be stewards of our community’s most vulnerable and important resource–our children. USF Pediatrics provides primary and specialty care for infants, children, and adolescents; develops treatments and cures for pediatric diseases through research; advances children’s issues through advocacy and community engagement; and trains future pediatricians, psychologists, and other allied health providers. The Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience is an integral part of USF’s Morsani College of Medicine. The department has received national and international recognition for research and innovative approaches to treatment. The mission of the department is to educate healthcare practitioners about mental, addictive, and behavioral disorders; advance scientific knowledge about the nature, causes, and treatment of these conditions; and provide exemplary models of clinical care to benefit the health and well-being of the people of Florida. The major goal of our internship is to provide an integrated, individually tailored, and coordinated series of learning experiences that will serve interns with opportunities to: (a) practice and expand on previously held knowledge and learned skills, (b) develop new skills and knowledge, and (c) experience personal and professional growth and development across clinical settings. Interns will serve populations across the lifespan, including infants, children, adolescents, families, and the primary care providers who regularly interact with children and families (e.g., physicians, teachers). During internship training, interns will engage in learning experiences that are designed to be cumulative in nature. Through daily activities, interns will have opportunities to achieve the following training objectives: 1. Apply ethical decision-making to complex clinical and research activities 2. Develop knowledge and skills in delivering services within primary care settings and collaborate across settings and care providers 3. Develop and demonstrate a commitment to evidence-based intervention procedures 4. Receive exposure to a diversity of psychological and mental health services within broad community contexts and across a breadth of treatment facilities 5. Demonstrate a commitment to diversity and individual differences 6. Develop an appreciation for and commitment to research, including scientific practices and/or research activities 7. Generate research questions related to work with clients and answer those questions 8. Develop competencies to evaluate the efficacy of the trainee’s work with diverse clients and systems Our internship offers experiences in child and adolescent assessment and therapy, and in infant and early childhood assessment and intervention through the birth-three Early Steps Program. As part of these assignments, interns will gain experience in several ways. They will gain experience in comprehensive psychoeducational evaluations for common childhood disorders (e.g., ADHD, SLD, anxiety, IDD, and ASD) and evidence-based recommendations for treatment. Also, they will gain experience in adolescent mental health and therapy including the treatment of diverse populations (e.g., gender dysphoria, trauma history, OCD, anxiety); treatment for early childhood disruptive behavior disorders (e.g., HOT DOCS and Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, trauma-informed early intervention), and integrated behavioral health within our primary care pediatric clinics.

Interns gain valuable experience working in an integrated health center with many opportunities to work in a multidisciplinary setting focused on prevention, intervention, and improving the well-being of the campus community. Our internship program has been fully accredited by the American Psychological Association since 1995 and was fully reaccredited in 2017 for 10 years. We have an enthusiastic and committed training staff who take great pride in our mission to provide a comprehensive, culturally compentent, developmental training experience, with an emphasis on learning through application of evidence-based practice in psychology. We believe people learn and work best in a supportive, inclusive, and collegial atmosphere. we strive to provide an environment that encourages intern development of professional and personal identity, clinical skills, confidence, autonomy, and self-awareness and cultural competency. Interns at UST/CAPS gain experience in individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychological assessment, supervision, and outreach and consultation. Past and present interns describe our program as a supportive learning environment in which they can realize their personal and professional goals. The doctoral internship at the University of St. Thomas Counseling and Psychological Services is deeply committed to the training of future psychologists from a culturally competent framework. The program is committed to cultural competency and is predicated on the idea that psychology practice is enhanced when we develop a broader and more adept view of what it is to be human – with infinite cultural variations and individual differences. We believe that our practice advances when we make a conscious intent to use our skills, knowledge, awareness, and sensitivity to effectively communicate and function within any given diverse context or encounter. Consequently, our approach to cultural competency training focuses on the following key domains: cultural skill, cultural knowledge, cultural awareness, and cultural sensitivity. Culture and Diversity Training Program Philosophy Our program has many strengths, including up to 8 hours per week in individual and group supervision with an experienced staff of supervisors; Intern Seminar, a joint training with interns from the University of Minnesota Student Counseling Center on various topics, including ethics, empirically-supported treatments, assessment, diversity issues and multicultural counseling, and counseling students with specific psychological disorders; a robust groups program where interns have opprtunity to gain extensive experience in both interpersonal process groups and psychoeducation group. The intern also provides individual supervision to a practicum student in both the Fall and Spring semester. We also have a robust assessment rotation to engage in psychological assessment of ADHD and Learning Disability, which each intern will participate in for one semester. Our interns are fully integrated into our center and are regarded by the wider university community as professional mental health staff. Finally, we are fully committed to internship training and are invested in the success of our interns each year. Our program is fully compliant with the 2017 Commission on Accreditation Standards of Accreditation and interns are trained to meet the CoA Profession-wide competencies: Research, Ethical and legal standards, Individual and Cultural Diversity, Professional values, attitudes, and behaviors, Communication and interpersonal skills, Assessment, and Intervention.

The UTD Student Counseling Center’s primary training modality is experiential, emphasizing clinical practice and service delivery with the goal of creating ethical and well-rounded generalist mental health practitioners who hold knowledge related to considering identity and intersectionality in clinical work. We follow a developmental approach to facilitate the transition from graduate student to professional psychologist, particularly as we work with trainees at varying stages of development (i.e., beginning/advanced practicum trainees, doctoral interns). By working closely with senior staff and supervisors, trainees assume increasing levels of responsibility and autonomy, expanding their professional roles as training progresses. Training is designed to facilitate trainees' clinical competence, foster the continued development of professional/clinical judgment, and integrate research and evidence-based practice. Enhancement of awareness, knowledge, and skills related to identity and intersectionality is integral in clinical training. Our training philosophy integrates a relational model which utilizes self-reflection, authenticity, and mutual growth. We are also deeply committed to facilitating the integration of personal and professional identities through engaging in supportive, yet challenging supervisory and mentoring relationships.

Individuals with permanent residency (green card), however, will not have this problem because they do not need a visa. Program Description The University of Texas Mc Govern Medical School’s Louis A Faillace, MD Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences offers a 1 year full time internship to doctoral students in psychology. The purpose of the internship is to provide broad, evidence-based clinical training with children, adolescents, and adults. The internship follows a scientist-practitioner training model , and is designed to prepare interns for careers in a variety of clinical and academic settings. The internship is accredited by APA since 2016 and has applied for re-accreditation. UTHealth Doctoral Psychology Internship Program provides a generalist internship program. This year our program is offering tracks for the first time. The five tracks available are Addiction (match number 229411), Trauma (match number 229413), Child and Adolescent (match number 229415), Adult Inpatient (match number 229411) and Developmental/Assessment (match number 229414 ). Applicants may apply to any of the tracks or more than one. However, applicants may apply to only ONE track. Applicants should choose the track for which they are most qualified by past training and experience. When matched to a track, the intern will be assigned 2 rotation blocks from that track and one from another track, in accordance with our Generalist training model. Interns should expect to be challenged to grow during the internship year, within the context of a supportive program in which supervisors work directly with interns in an apprenticeship training model. Application deadline is November 3, 2025. Other features of the program include a strong didactic component, a large and highly qualified psychology faculty of various cultural backgrounds, opportunities for interdisciplinary work and consultation, inpatient experiences, mutidisciplinary settings, and research mentorship with protected research time. Interns have generous benefits and receive 3 days of professional leave as part of their program. Stipends are competitive. The program is in Houston, Texas, a large, friendly city including many different cultural and socioeconomic groups, a high quality of life and relatively low cost of living. The McGovern Medical School is located in the Texas Medical Center, a very large campus containing multiple institutions of higher education as well a numerous hospitals and research facilities. The Louis A Faillace MD Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences has two primary locations, including its own psychiatric hospital campus (the Dunn Behavioral Sciences Center). Interns have the opportunity to work with underserved populations of clients with a very wide range of mental health problems. The Houston area also contains numerous opportunities for postdoctoral positions. UTHDPIP encourages applicants of all backgrounds and communities to apply.

We provide dynamic training to prepare you for the multifaceted roles needed for a career in college counseling, and beyond. We have a strong focus on consultation and outreach skills and provide numerous opportunities to work with students, parents, faculty, and campus and community partners. We provide a supportive, open, and understanding work environment, and have a true open door policy (even virtually!) where our staff are available for our doctoral trainees throughout each day. We emphasize the ethical importance of developing a self-care routine that increases your resiliency and helps you to succeed in this field. THE AIM OF OUR APA-ACCREDITED TRAINING PROGRAM: We aim to prepare you to become a competent, versatile, and culturally aware Health Service Psychologist who engages in and helps others attain lasting achievement and responsible leadership in careers and community. WHY CHOOSE PACIFIC FOR YOUR INTERNSHIP: We infuse culture and diversity into all aspects of our program (e.g., seminars, meetings, and specific spaces for conversations around DEI topics). We strive to provide experiences that allow for interpersonal depth and enhanced clinical ability within a culturally-aware humanistic framework. We are committed to promoting excellence and competence in the development and refinement of psychological skill levels. We operate under the principle that early career professionals need to develop a strong professional identity within their own discipline and an ability to work collaboratively with other mental healthcare professionals. We believe that this development happens through experience, supervision, and mentoring. We will help you demonstrate self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, cultural awareness, and professional deportment with increasing levels of responsibility over the course of the year as these skills will provide a strong foundation for independence in the practice of Health Service Psychology. Each of our licensed staff members provide a different set of skills, training, and experiences. Our supervisors use a developmental model of supervision that embraces a humanistic underpinning with a multicultural focus. We provide you the opportunity to broaden your knowledge and skill base through exposure to a variety of theoretical perspectives and intervention approaches. Doctoral interns are given the opportunity to assess, diagnose, and provide treatment for a wide range of presenting concerns--from expected developmental and situational issues to significant psychopathology and characterological concerns. We have a thriving group psychotherapy program. You will have the opportunity to co-facilitate with an experienced group therapist a process group or one of our support groups with undergraduate, graduate, and professional students across all three campuses (virtually and in-person). We offer opportunities to provide brief and long-term individual therapy utilizing a stepped care model, and engage in assessment through utilizing the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms (CCAPS) each session and learning about and utilizing ADHD assessments. Additionally, there are opportunities for couples counseling on an as requested basis. We train interns on how to conduct an informal needs assessment leading to development and implementation of outreach in a variety of formats (e.g., handouts, videos, in-person presentations, and tabling) across the university campus (first semester) and in the community (second semester). We are a very active unit within the larger Division of Student Life, and maintain strong collaborative relationships with our partners throughout the university. In keeping with APA Standards of Accreditation, we expect interns of the Pacific Internship Training Program to respond professionally in increasingly complex situations, with a greater degree of independence on the nine profession-wide competencies determined through the APA Standards of Accreditation .

This is consistent with the supportive, strengths-based approach to our training program. Program Description The UCC embraces a scientist-practitioner training philosophy to train Health Service Psychology interns in a comprehensive outpatient multidisciplinary agency; staff members include licensed psychologists, social workers, master's level mental health counselors (CMHC and LMFT), and psychiatric nurse practitioners. We provide preventive, developmental, and therapeutic services to a large and diverse university community. The agency has a strong and enduring commitment to diversity and inclusion. We consistently strive to integrate multiculturalism into our everyday functioning. We advocate a philosophy of acceptance, compassion, and support for those we serve, as well as for each other. We have equally strong commitments to high-quality service delivery and to training. Specific opportunities include: Counseling with individuals, groups, and people in committed relationships; Intervening in mental health crises; Providing clinical supervision to doctoral practicum trainees; Facilitating workshops through the SWAMP (Skills Workshops and Mindfulness Programming); Conducting campus outreach/consultation; and Completing formal assessment batteries and test reports. Each intern completes a Systems Intervention Project (SIP). Interns participate in intern training seminars in critical positionalities & diversity, group therapy, outreach & consultation, relationship therapy, applied ethics, professional development, psychological assessment, evidence-based practice, professional licensing and standards, and clinical supervision. Research opportunities are available. Please see our website for a complete description of our training program: http://counselingcenter.utah.edu/ The UCC is committed to increasing awareness, knowledge, and advocacy about human diversity and culture so that meaningful, effective interconnections can lead to adaptive changes on individual and societal levels. We recognize that people do not live outside of cultural contexts, and we actively explore the impacts of systems of power and oppression in our understanding of mental health and mental health treatment. Our goal is for all eligible students, faculty, and staff to be able to access our services and feel accepted and understood regardless of culture, ethnicity, gender (including identity and expression), generation, lifestyle, religion/spirituality, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, size, national origin, language, or physical and mental functioning. As mental health professionals who adhere to the respective professional ethics and standards of the various mental-health disciplines represented at the UCC, we have a personal and professional responsibility to: Identify and understand our own attitudes, biases, assumptions, and values about human behavior; Recognize and demonstrate awareness of clients' world-views, including his/her/their attitudes, biases, assumptions, and values; Educate ourselves so that we can better understand the influence and impact of our culture within the counseling relationship; Provide multiculturally-oriented and effective counseling (e.g., appropriate help-giving practices, intervention strategies, and cultural structures) to all eligible students, faculty, and staff; and Promote the intellectual, emotional, social, psychological, and/or spiritual development of our clients and campus community. In order to meet this goal, we consistently strive to integrate multiculturalism into the everyday functioning and structure of our agency, including the organizational, administrative, training, service, and individual levels. While this integration of multiculturalism is reflected in the UCC’s policies, procedures, and programming, our mission to promote multiculturalism and eliminate prejudicial and discriminatory practices (APA, 2003) extends not only to ourselves, but also outside our agency to the campus and surrounding communities. As detailed below, UCC has numerous campus and community diversity-related organizational partners and is an institutional member of the LGBTQ-Affirmative Therapist Guild of Utah .

Positions begin in July 2026. The University of Vermont Medical Center serves a population of more than 1 million people in Vermont and northern New York, is home to the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital, and provides a full range of inpatient and outpatient services across 10 Vermont Locations. The aim of the UVMMC Clinical Psychology Internship program is to provide generalist training focused on delivering services to rural populations in an intellectually stimulating and respectful environment that prepares interns to deliver effective, entry level psychological services to diverse populations in multidisciplinary settings across a continuum of care . We also strive to offer students opportunities to explore and gain experience in more specialized service areas to enhance their understanding of themselves as clinicians and inform their future training and career choices. The internship follows a Practitioner-Scholar Model that provides psychology interns the skills and training necessary to become successful practitioners of child, adolescent, and/or adult psychology, with an emphasis on delivering psychological services within a rural medical center setting. The program is a one-year, full-time placement with a focus in either pediatric and child/adolescent clinical psychology or adult clinical rotations. Interns will be expected to work 40 to 50 hours per week. Typically, the training year will begin in July and end in June. Adult Medical Psychology: Interns will provide consultation/liaison services to the inpatient medical units as well as to outpatient subspecialty clinics (i.e. hematology/oncology, GI/psychogastroenterology, and behavioral sleep medicine) including brief diagnostic interviews, consultation with the medical teams, ongoing inpatient psychotherapy, attendance at multidisciplinary care conferences, and multidisciplinary rounds. We have added a year-long experience learning about Liberation Psychology with the opportunity to carry a small outpatient caseload utilizing Liberation approaches to treatment. Pediatric and Child/Adoloscent Clinical Psychology: We operate in a largely resource challenged area and provide not only direct service but consultation to services across the region. We provide generalist training in clinical child/adolescent and pediatric psychology to better serve the diverse needs of our community. Training will focus on providing evidence-based behavioral health services for pediatric populations in academic medical center inpatient and outpatient settings. Interns will provide consultation/liaison to medical teams, brief assessment and intervention services to hospitalized children and adolescents and their families, and attend multidisciplinary rounds and care conferences. They will also offer services in outpatient multidisciplinary subspecialty clinics (e.g., CF, hem/onc, IBD, behavioral sleep, and endocrinology). Interns will be provided with a range of didactic experiences and mentoring to ensure core competencies are met and to help prepare interns for transition into entry level psychologist positions.

Program Description Counselling is a part of the Student Wellness Centre (SWC) located in the Health and Wellness Building on campus and provides psychological services to UVic students, as well as consulting services to members of the University community. The SWC, housing both Health and Counselling, strives to provide holistic care and service delivery in a fully integrated, collaborative, inter-professional model in close partnership with Multifaith as a third unit within the SWC portfolio. Our Pre-Doctoral Psychology Residency Program adopts a scientist-practitioner model and is designed to be generalist in nature. Our program provides training in eight core competency areas: Intervention (individual and group counselling), assessment, supervision in professional practice, consultation and outreach, diversity, applied research, program development and program evaluation, and professional ethics, conduct and standards. At Counselling, residents are viewed as early emerging professionals who are engaged in much of the same activities as the rest of the clinical team. Residents have access to the same on site training/professional development opportunities as clinical staff, and are included in the weekly group supervision with the clinical team and other planning meetings. All staff members of Counselling are integral to the learning and training environment and interact regularly with the residents over the course of the residency year. We strive to create a learning and work environment that is supportive and collegial, committed to professional development in the service of the client population with whom we work, and respectful of individual differences. Additionally, we have two training experiences built into our residency: the Behavioural Health Provider (BHP) and the Eating Disorder Collective (EDC); these are part of, and are woven into, the overall competencies associated with our residency and we approach these from a developmental perspective and progression. As a division of Student Affairs and a unit within Wellness, Recreation, and Athletics at UVic, Counselling is involved in a number of inter-unit collaborations on campus. This includes counselling specific efforts (e.g., Indigenous counsellors available in collaboration with the Office of Indigenous Academic and Community Engagement; group counselling offerings in partnership with Multifaith), multi-disciplinary care coordination (e.g., care coordination team with Centre for Accessible Learning, Health, case managers), and event-based partnerships. Such campus collaborations offer a rich and diverse learning experience for residents at Counselling. We acknowledge and respect the L?k ???ŋ?n (Songhees and X ?seps?m/Esquimalt) Peoples on whose territory the university stands, and the L?k ???ŋ?n and W ?S ÁNE Ć Peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

Program Description The UVA CAPS American Psychological Association-accredited program provides culturally informed and evidence-based doctoral internship training in Health Service Psychology (HSP) within a multidisciplinary university counseling center. Psychologists practicing in university counseling centers are recognized as providing Health Service Psychology if they are duly trained and experienced in delivering preventive, assessment, diagnostic, and therapeutic intervention services related to the psychological and physical health of clients. The internship program offers three full-time, 12-month positions, requiring the completion of a minimum of 500 direct hours and 2000 total hours. Our internship program provides a structured and progressive training experience aimed at fostering the development of core clinical and counseling skills, as well as professional attitudes and behaviors. The program's goal is to develop compassionate and authentic professionals prepared for general health service psychology practice in various clinical settings, focusing on individual and group psychotherapy, crisis intervention, supervision, outreach, and university consultation. CAPS also supports the development of individual interests and beginning specialties, deeply valuing an affirming attitude toward a range of individual differences. We fully support training psychologists who are competent to serve all members of the public, as described in ""Preparing Professional Psychologists to Serve a Diverse Public"" (APA, 2013), as an essential component of our profession. The internship program is based on a developmental-practitioner approach, building on the knowledge and skills interns acquire during doctoral training and preparing them for entry-level positions as health service psychologists. Training activities are primarily experiential, supported by didactic material, to facilitate learning in the provision of clinical services to students, outreach and consultation with university community members, utilization of research and scholarly material to support evidence-based practice, and provision of supervision. Interns further develop knowledge, skills, and attitudes to support professional functioning in the areas of ethics, cultural and individual differences, use and provision of supervision, inter-professional and interdisciplinary clinical consultation, communication and interpersonal skills, and overall professional values and attitudes. Our individual psychotherapy training focuses on the application of contemporary relational and emotion-informed brief therapy models integrated with skills-based practice as clinically indicated. Group therapy is predominantly informed by process and psycho-educational models of treatment.

In accordance with the premise that individual change & learning occurs within the context of significant human interaction, the supervisor-intern relationship & other mentoring relationships are key in the training program. This internship provides interns with a rich & varied learning experience that combines graduated learning & practice with science. Thus, the training program begins with an extensive orientation period & assessment of the intern's individual training needs. As the training year progresses, the number of didactic experiences decrease & the interns are given increasing clinical responsibility & autonomy. The primary focus of the internship training is to assist interns in integrating academic foundations with professional practice. This is accomplished by facilitating professional learning & personal growth by means of supervised clinical experience, didactic seminars, continued exposure to psychological literature, & collegial interaction throughout the year. Interns gain experience in individual short-term psychotherapy and related therapy skills, group counseling, psychological assessment, ethical & legal issues, diversity, consultation, and outreach programming. The program is dedicated to the enhancement of the ethical, multicultural/social justice, & professional development of interns. Interns are encouraged to offer professional contributions in staff meetings & clinical teams, seminars, & outreach presentations. Upon completion of the internship, the developing professional will have sufficient experience in a university counseling center and general psychotherapeutic practices to confidently and competently carry out the responsibilities of an entry-level professional in a variety of settings. Successful completion of internship requires a) completing 2000 hours of which 25% is direct service and b) passing all learning elements of the nine profession-wide competencies with a minimum of Level 3 (competent).

Interns also participate in the University’s holiday schedule (11 Washington State-recognized holidays annually), accrue sick and vacation time off, and receive an annual personal holiday. The intern salary is considered non-exempt from overtime according to the Fair Labor Standards Act and Washington Minimum Wage Act. Interns are not allowed to accrue overtime hours. Specifically, interns: • are allotted 1 personal holiday (to be taken at any time during the year with supervisor approval). • accrue 10 hours of vacation per month of completed employment (totaling 120 hours or 15 days of vacation annually). Vacation may be taken following the first month’s accrual. Interns are asked to reserve 5 vacation days for the last 5 days of internship to allow staff to transition and prepare for the incoming trainees. • accrue 8 hours of sick leave per month of completed employment (totaling 96 hours or 12 days of sick leave annually). Sick time off accrues at the end of the month in which it is earned and is available for use the following month. • are allotted 5 days of professional leave (e.g. to defend a dissertation or attend professional meetings and conferences). Brief description of the typical work day for an intern at this training site Interns work a standard week, 8 AM to 5 PM Monday-Friday with a one hour lunch. Service hours, when clients are seen, are 9 AM to 4 PM. On any given day, an intern may have a training seminar or staff meeting, 3-4 individual clients, lunch, a group to co-facilitate with senior staff, individual supervision, and an hour for note writing. Activities vary each day. There is no after-hours crisis on-call and the center rarely accepts after-hours outreach requests. Depending on the policy followed by all of Student Affairs staff, interns may be allotted work from home time, but this is not guaranteed. It is typically true for one day per week in the summer. A university laptop will be requested to borrow, but cannot be guaranteed, and thus interns may have to use their personal technology if they wish to work from home. UW Tacoma's PAWS prizes a collegial environment and interns are supported by all staff within the department as well as our colleagues throughout the Division of Student Affairs and the broader campus. Does this site have practicum psychology students on site? Yes Doctoral Psychology Practicum Students Yes Masters Psychology Practicum Students No Do Psychology Interns/Postdocs Have the Opportunity to Supervise Practicum Students? Yes Is this program fully affiliated with one or more doctoral programs? No Is this program partially affiliated with one or more doctoral programs? No Internship Application Process Accepting Applicants: Yes Application Due Date: 11/23/2025 11:59 PM EST A Virtual Interview are: Required Interview notification date: 12/22/2025 Tentative interview date: 01/05/2026-01/15/2026 Interview process description: APPLICATION INFO: Please include all essays, a cover letter specific to our site, CV, and all graduate transcripts. 3 letters of recommendation - at least TWO letters must be from DIRECT CLINICAL SUPERVISORS who can speak to your clinical skills. Letters from group supervisors are typically less helpful than those from 1:1 primary supervisors. This better helps us assess your strengths and areas for growth in terms of goodness of fit with our site. Please do not include any assessment reports or other extra materials. HOURS: Our minimum intervention and assessment hours are preferred, but flexible. We will consider other aspects of the application for goodness of fit in addition to hours. IF YOU DO NOT MEET MINIMUM INTERVENTION HOURS, p lease include in your cover letter a brief description of the circumstances that prevented you from completing your expected clinical training and a description of what you did instead. If this is not included in your cover letter, your application will likely not be reviewed. We welcome applications from all applicants who feel strongly about completing their training with us. INVITATION TO INTERVIEW: Following a review of online application materials, applicants whose training, experience, and professional goals most closely parallel the training opportunities available at PAWS will be invited to participate in a Zoom interview. ZOOM INTERVIEWS: The Zoom interviews (of each candidate, one at a time) will take place approximately Jan. 5-15, 2026, with an interview notification date of 12/22/25. We use the NMS Interview scheduling system to attempt to make the scheduling process as equitable as possible. At least two staff members will be present for the 45-50 minute Zoom interviews and take turns asking questions. The selection committee meets as a team at the conclusion of the interviews to discuss the candidates and all staff and current interns contribute to the ratings and rankings. The Training Director submits and certifies the rank list before the ranking deadline and before the optional open house. COMMITMENT TO EQUITY: Our site is committed to implementing practices in the intern application and interviewing process that are as free from bias as possible. We recognize the socioeconomic impact of traveling for interviews, and thus do not conduct on-site interviews. While there is no way to avoid bias completely, we hope that by offering Zoom interviews and identifying as a staff the assumptions we may make (and thus avoid) based on candidate appearance, accent, visible surroundings and other factors, we are inviting candidates to participate in a process that is imperfect, though thoughtfully and equitably designed. OPEN HOUSE: We offer an entirely optional virtual open house for candidates who feel strongly about in some way “visiting” a site before making their decision. Previous candidates who attended our open house cited it as the most helpful way to get a feel for our site and staff. The open house includes an introduction of the whole staff; Q&A with the current interns only; and Q&A with the training director who presents a slideshow of the office, campus, employee celebrations, and even staff pets! The open house will be scheduled in January and details will be sent to candidates following interviews. The open house occurs after we have determined our rank order list, and before candidates are required to submit theirs. We welcome candidates to learn as much as they can about us to decide about best fit without concern that their visit may influence our rankings of them. Again, we do not consider open house attendance in any way in our ranking decisions . Candidates are welcome to contact the Training Director ( bonniebp@uw.edu ), other staff members, and current interns at any time with questions. The Training Director is happy to forward email inquiries to the staff/trainees for their responses directly to you. BACKGROUND CHECK: If a candidate matches with our site, UW Tacoma will conduct a national criminal conviction background check (at no cost to the candidate) along with a self-disclosure questionnaire that will be submitted to UW Human Resources. The background check typically occurs within 3 months of the internship start date. While hiring is contingent upon successful completion of a background check, a criminal conviction is not an automatic bar to being hired at PAWS. Eligibility for hiring will be determined by the PAWS administration in consultation with UW Human Resources. Applicants who match to our program but do not successfully pass this background check will not be hired as doctoral psychology interns.

Program Description UNIQUE UNIVERSITY COUNSELING CENTER INTERNSHIP : The APA-accredited internship at UW Tacoma Psychological & Wellness Services (PAWS) is unique among UCC internships. Our student population is racially/ethnically diverse, traditional and non-traditional in age, economically disenfranchised, and from regional high schools and community colleges. Many are the first in their family to attend college. Ten percent are military affiliated. A fair number present with trauma histories. These are bright, dedicated students and our campus takes pride in their accomplishments. We enjoy a close relationship with Student Affairs, which offers interns the opportunity to learn about all aspects of student life. As therapists, we are honored to serve our students, and we hope you will find as much fulfillment in working here as we do! Our staff is enthusiastic about training; we value the development of trusting professional relationships, the use of supportive feedback, and dedicated efforts toward social justice. Please visit our website and open the Brochure or click through the training pages to learn about Tacoma, the UWT student population, our commitment to diversity, opportunities to provide direct services, seminars, supervision, and other specific elements of our internship training program. *Weekly Activities : Up to 20 hrs Direct Clinical Service [group therapy, individual therapy, same-day appts & crisis sessions (NO after-hours crisis on-call), occasional outreach]; 1.5 hrs supervision of practicum trainees; 3 hrs Didactic Seminars (1.5 hr Clinical & Professional Topics and 1.5 hr Multicultural); 4+ hrs Receiving Supervision (2 hr 1:1 sup, 1.5-2 hr sup of groups, 1 hr sup of sup, 1 hr group sup/case conference); Other Activities include clinical documentation/case management, 1 hr staff meeting, and occasional Psychology Research Seminar Series departmental presentations. Interns' direct service hours are closely monitored and capped to ensure that the educational experience of internship is prioritized; the internship position is non-exempt from overtime and interns are not permitted to acccrue overtime hours. At full capacity, interns would spend up to 50% of their time per week providing direct clinical services. Supervision of Practicum Trainees: The PAWS advanced practicum program is technically a “preinternship” in WA parlance, and as such, practicum trainees (from regional doctoral programs) must receive their supervision from a licensed psychologist. Thus, to afford interns the opportunity to supervise, we provide co-supervision of practicum trainees. We initially have interns sit in to observe individual supervision of practicum trainees by senior staff and offer input as they feel ready to do so. Later, senior staff sit in with interns as they provide supervision to practicum trainees. Psychological & Wellness Services Staff: PAWS is staffed by four full-time licensed psychologists. Our leadership structure includes the Director, Training Director, Group Therapy Coordinator, and Outreach Coordinator. A full-time Program Coordinator provides administrative support services. We also have a full-time Health Promotions Specialist (a non-clinician) who serves as our Outreach Coordinator. Each staff member is highly invested in our training program and is eager to support interns’ personal and professional growth throughout the year. Our staff have a variety of theoretical orientations but all work within a developmental framework. We all share a commitment to diversity and social justice. We would love to welcome you to Washington!

Program Description Doctoral Internship in Health Service Psychology University Health and Counseling Services (UHCS) University of Wisconsin–Whitewater The University Health and Counseling Services (UHCS) at the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater offers a comprehensive, APA-accredited doctoral internship in Health Service Psychology. Our program is designed to prepare emerging professionals for generalist practice in college counseling centers and a variety of mental health settings through a yearlong, full-time, 2,000-hour training experience grounded in the practitioner-scholar model. UHCS has a long-standing legacy of training master’s and doctoral students in psychology, counseling, and social work. Our internship, accredited by the American Psychological Association in 2019, offers two fully funded positions each year. Interns are welcomed into a collaborative, inclusive, and multidisciplinary environment within a merged center that includes Counseling, Health, Interpersonal Violence and Prevention Education, and Wellness services. Training Philosophy and Model UHCS emphasizes a developmental, experiential approach to training. We view interns as emerging professionals and strive to provide the right balance of support, challenge, autonomy, and responsibility. Training integrates theory, research, ethics, and responsiveness to individual and cultural differences. Interns gain exposure to diverse clinical perspectives through supervision and mentoring from psychologists, licensed counselors, medical staff, and wellness professionals. The practitioner-scholar model supports sequential learning through direct clinical experience, didactic seminars, supervision, and self-reflection. Interns are encouraged to maintain lifelong learning habits and integrate current research into their clinical work. Core Training Components Direct Clinical Services Interns develop core competencies in individual (15–17 clients/week), group, and couples (if appropriate) counseling; intake assessment (up to 5 per week); and crisis intervention (weekly daytime on-call shifts). Group counseling and psychoeducational workshops are encouraged, with offerings adapted to student needs. Assessment Interns complete at least two ADHD screening assessments monthly and participate in weekly Assessment Seminar. A range of standardized instruments is available, and supervision supports thoughtful, culturally informed assessment practices. Supervision Interns receive 2 hours/week of individual supervision (rotated mid-year) and 2 hours/week of group supervision. Supervision of supervision occurs biweekly, as interns provide direct supervision to master’s-level counseling interns under faculty oversight. Outreach and Consultation Interns engage in consultations, outreach presentations, and campus events. They participate in biweekly Diversity Outreach Seminar and complete a capstone project focused on serving underserved or systemically marginalized populations. Interns also provide drop-in consultation at targeted campus locations. Training and Professional Development Didactic Seminars Weekly seminars address advanced clinical topics such as suicide prevention, AODA, trauma, ACT/DBT, and culturally responsive care. Each intern presents a diversity-related seminar in the spring semester. Case Consultation Interns participate with all Counseling staff in weekly collaborative case meetings focused on intake disposition, complex cases, ethical issues, and peer consultation. Diversity Outreach Seminar A dedicated biweekly seminar supports development and implementation of interns’ outreach projects, integrating identity, inclusion, and community engagement. Professional Development Interns are granted up to 2 hours/week for dissertation work or exam prep during certain periods in the academic year. In summer, interns complete a scholarly project (e.g., resource development, continuing education, or research-informed programming), with faculty support. Program Aims Aim 1: Develop clinical competencies and professional identity as a generalist psychologist through evidence-based, ethical individual and group therapy, crisis response, and supervision. Aim 2: Foster cultural humility, self-awareness, and lifelong engagement in culturally responsive practice. Aim 3: Build competence in consultation and outreach within a multidisciplinary health and counseling center.

Brief description of the typical work day for an intern at this training site A typical day of an intern may vary based on their primary site. UT-PIC interns are primarily placed at one training site. Time at each site includes clinical work, supervision, and all tasks related to or in support of the clinical work. All interns spend 10% of their time engaged in group didactic activities and group supervision primarily via videoconference. Some training sites also offer interns the opportunity to complete elective rotations within their site. Elective rotations vary by site and from year-to-year, but might include outreach, autism, forensic, homeless, substance use disorders, child day treatment, etc. The Intermountain Healthcare Psychiatry and Counseling interns in St. George and Park City spend the day providing individual and group therapy as well as some assessment. At Utah Tech, a typical day involves brief therapy, crisis intervention, and campus mental health outreach activities. At Valley Behavioral Health, interns have the opportunity for a broad training experience and split their time between treatment (individual, group, and family therapy) and psychological evaluation services embedded within the Child, Youth and Family Outpatient clinic in West Valley City of Salt Lake County. Solstice Counseling & Wellness is a private practice clinic so a typical day might include intake assessments, individual/couples/family/group therapy, and psychological testing or assessment. The intern will also have the opportunity to attend monthly meetings at the local Children's Justice Center and facilitate free community workshops. All UT-PIC interns are also required to complete three (3) UT-PIC mini-rotations at other training sites. The year begins with an Orientation in southern Utah that focuses on orientation to the UT-PIC program and Utah-specific issues related to psychological practice. Each intern also travels to Utah Tech University for a multiple day rotation focused on outreach and advocacy. Each intern travels to our Salt Lake City area location for a two-day experience that emphasizes intensive training in an evidence based modality of therapy. All UT-PIC interns participate in the following didactic activities: • Didactic seminars via videoconference – 2 hours/week • Weekly group supervision – 2 hours/week • Weekly individual supervision – 2 hours/week • Direct clinical service – 10-20 hours/week • Rotation/Orientation in likely in Cedar City to gain exposure to Utah-specific issues in psychological practice – 1 day • Rotation at Utah Tech University to gain experience with outreach and advocacy at a university counseling center– 1-2 days • Rotation at Intermountain Healthcare in order to gain exposure to a community mental health setting and focused evidence-based treatment topic – 2 days • Graduation – 1 day Additional training and consultation opportunities may be available at each site.

Program Description The Utah State Hospital doctoral internship program is designed to comprehensively train interns to reach career and/or postdoctoral fellowship goals in the specialty areas of Clinical Psychology, Forensic Psychology, and Neuropsychology, while also ensuring strong foundational and generalist skills. Our training model is defined as “practitioner-scholar” and is experiential in nature. Interns are expected to apply graduate training to “real world” clinical situations. This philosophy emphasizes the development of professional skills, critical thinking ability, and professional ethics. Interns are provided with a graded sequence of experiences, responsibility and independence increase as competency and comfort increases. Thus, as interns progress through the training program, they are expected to broaden and deepen their clinical knowledge and demonstrate increased independence, in a manner consistent with the hospital’s mission of providing excellent inpatient psychiatric care. The internship is structured to provide supervised experience working with patients of different ages, backgrounds and ethnicity, with diverse presenting problems and varying degrees of symptomatic severity. Supervisors serve as role models to challenge and guide, as well as to ensure interventions and assessments are completed with fidelity to the model. The internship program training philosophy is based on an integration of experiential, theoretical, and empirical knowledge. Interns are provided a venue in which clinical experience, didactic training, and ongoing research components integrate to produce state-of-the-art, individualized, and sensitive patient care. Training procedures emphasize mentoring and graduated responsibility, in the context of evaluation, treatment delivery, and outcome assessment. The program provides sequential training within a format of two consecutive rotations, a primary rotation completed during the first 8 months of internship, which typically aligns with the specialty area the intern matched with, followed by a secondary rotation in a separate specialty. Additionally, in order to honor our dedication to generalist training there is a year-long mandatory group and individual therapy component. Rotation options include: Clinical Psychology, Forensic Psychology, and Neuropsychology. Throughout the internship year, all interns will carry a caseload of two long-term individual patients, in addition to facilitating or co-facilitating two therapy groups. Evidence based interventions should also be chosen. Groups interns facilitate are expected to be evidence based and meet the needs of our patients, recent groups offered to patients have included the following: Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Social Skills Training for Schizophrenia, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Schizophrenia, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Psychosis, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Mood Disorder and Anxiety, Seeking Safety, and Competency Restoration.

Program Description USU CAPS doctoral internship in Health Service Psychology provides quality training focused on eight basic areas of psychological practice important in a university counseling center or similar setting: individual therapy; group therapy; psycho-educational and psychological assessment; outreach and consultation activities; providing clinical supervision; awareness of and responsiveness to issues of human diversity; ethical and professional behavior; and professional development. While interns at CAPS are expected to function semi-autonomously, they can also expect to work and learn in an atmosphere characterized by respect and support. Overall, the goal of our internship is to create mentoring relationships and a learning environment in which interns can hone their skills and grow professionally in a safe and supervised setting. We respect the dignity, backgrounds and individuality of all. This drives our effort to develop a community of belonging in which differences are respected and valued. In addition to a number of required core experiences, our training allows an intern flexibility in choosing elective experiences consistent with their professional goals. Through the outreach consultation and professional development projects, interns have the opportunity to customize their internship. Coordinating these two projects, an intern can create a specialty rotation or focal area.

A background check is a process a person or company uses to verify that a person is who they claim to be, and provides an opportunity for someone to check a person’s criminal record, education, employment history, and other past activities in order to confirm their validity. Having a criminal conviction does not automatically preclude employment. The People and Culture designee, in consultation with the Office of General Counsel, evaluates the relevance of the criminal history of the individual being considered for hire to the position being filled. The nature and gravity of the offense, the circumstances surrounding it, the proximity in time of the conviction and/or completion of sentence, and its relevance to the nature of the job for which the applicant has applied will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

A variety of training opportunities are provided with an emphasis in providing effective individual, couples, and group therapy, psychological assessment, and crisis intervention to the university's diverse student body.

Our psychology internship program offers didactic, experiential, and practical training activities in a number of outpatient mental health areas. Our goal is to train interns to be generalist clinicians who are competent in all of the APA profession-wide competency areas, and are ready to handle the demands of a job as a postdoctoral resident or entry-level psychologist in a wide range of psychology settings upon completion of their training. With this in mind, interns receive training in a broad spectrum of clinic settings including: Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program (BHIP)/General Mental Health, Trauma Recovery Services (TRS)/Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Substance Use Disorder treatment, Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI), Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Center (PRRC)/Serious Mental Illness (SMI), Women's Mental Health, and psychodiagnostic, functional, and cognitive assessment. Interns are trained in a variety of evidence-based practices and engage in seminars, supervision, and didactics to support their learning and professional development. The clinic is housed in a 5-story state-of-the-art building and is part of the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (GLAHCS), although separate and distinct from the other GLAHCS training programs. Our psychology service currently consists of 20 full-time psychologists and 4 part-time psychologists. Most psychology staff members currently participate in the internship training program.

Trainees who are not VA paid (without compensation-WOC) who are not U.S. citizens may be appointed and must provide current immigrant, non-immigrant or exchange visitor documents. 2. U.S. Social Security Number. All VA appointees must have a U.S. social security number (SSN) prior to beginning the pre-employment, on-boarding process at the VA. 3. Selective Service Registration. Male applicants born after 12/31/1959 must have registered for the Selective Service by age 26 to be eligible for U.S. government employment, including selection as a paid or WOC VA trainee. For additional information about the Selective Service System, and to register or to check your registration status visit https://www.sss.gov/. Anyone who was required to register but did not register before the age of 26 will need to apply for a Status Information Letter (SIL) and request a waiver. Waivers are rare and requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis by the VA Office of Human Resources Management. This process can take up to six months for a verdict. 4. Fingerprint Screening and Background Investigation. All HPTs will be fingerprinted and undergo screenings and background investigations. Additional details about the required background checks can be found at the following website: http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/10450.html. 5. Drug Testing. Per Executive Order 12564, the VA strives to be a Drug-Free Workplace. HPTs are not drug-tested prior to appointment, however are subject to random drug testing throughout the entire VA appointment period. You will be asked to sign an acknowledgement form stating you are aware of this practice. See item 8 below. Interns are required to follow federal guidelines associated with drug testing regardless of their state of residence. 6. Affiliation Agreement. To ensure shared responsibility between an academic program and the VA there must be a current and fully executed Academic Affiliation Agreement on file with the VHA Office of Academic Affiliations (OAA). The affiliation agreement delineates the duties of VA and the affiliated institution. Most APA-accredited doctoral programs have an agreement on file. More information about this document can be found at https://www.va.gov/oaa/agreements.asp (see section on psychology internships). Post-degree programs typically will not have an affiliation agreement, as the HPT is no longer enrolled in an academic program and the program is VA sponsored. 7. TQCVL. To streamline on-boarding of HPTs, VHA Office of Academic Affiliations requires completion of a Trainee Qualifications and Credentials Verification Letter (TQCVL). An Educational Official at the Affiliate must complete and sign this letter. For post-graduate programs where an affiliate is not the program sponsor, this process must be completed by the VA Training Director. Your VA appointment cannot happen until the TQCVL is submitted and signed by senior leadership from the VA facility. For more information about this document, please visit https://www.va.gov/OAA/TQCVL.asp a. Health Requirements. Among other things, the TQCVL confirms that you, the trainee, are fit to perform the essential functions (physical and mental) of the training program and immunized following current Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and VHA policy. This protects you, other employees and patients while working in a healthcare facility. Required are annual tuberculosis screening, Hepatitis B vaccine as well as annual influenza vaccine. Declinations are EXTREMELY rare. If you decline the flu vaccine you will be required to wear a mask while in patient care areas of the VA. Interns are required to follow hospital guidelines regarding vaccine and PPE precautions. b. Primary source verification of all prior education and training is certified via the TQCVL. Training and Program Directors will be contacting the appropriate institutions to ensure you have the appropriate qualifications and credentials as required by the admission criteria of the training program in which you are enrolled. 8. Additional On-boarding Forms. Additional pre-employment forms include the Application for Health Professions Trainees (VA 10-2850D) and the Declaration for Federal Employment (OF 306). These documents and others are available online for review at https://www.va.gov/oaa/app-forms.asp. Falsifying any answer on these required Federal documents will result in the inability to appoint or immediate dismissal from the training program. 9. Proof of Identity per VA. VA on-boarding requires presentation of two source documents (IDs). Documents must be unexpired and names on both documents must match. For more information visit: https://www.oit.va.gov/programs/piv/_media/docs/IDMatrix.pdf • Trainees receive term employee appointments and must meet eligibility requirements for appointment as outlined in VA Handbook 5005 Staffing, Part II, Section B. Appointment Requirements and Determinations. https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=646&FType=2 Please note that interns will also be required to follow all precautions and policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic including vaccine and PPE policies.

Interviews are by invitation only. All applicants will be notified by email on or before November 22, 2023 as to whether they are invited for an interview. All interviews will be conducted virtually. Interview Process: Invited applicants will be scheduled for a virtual interview experience. Details of this experience were arranged 4 years ago, in collaboration with the Academy of Psychological Clinical Science's Workgroup on Reducing Barriers to Psychology Education and Training. VA Boston Healthcare System's virtual interviews will consist of: An introduction to our internship site and an overview of our interview, application, and ranking process, with Dr. Sloan. Individual interviews with one or more faculty from the clinical rotations of most interest to the applicant, as primary clinical rotations Potential group interviews with faculty from clinical rotations in which the applicant has interest in exploring as possible secondary clinical rotations Presentation from Psychology Committee members. Opportunities to meet with and ask questions to our current interns Question and answer sessions with our internship training director. Interview Dates: Invited applicants will be scheduled for interviews in December and January. We anticipate that virtual meetings with our internship director, diversity committee members, and current interns will all occur on one of 6 interview dates in December and January, as well as the individual and group meetings with clinical rotation faculty. Invited applicants will receive an electronic invitation to rank-order their interview date preferences. This will be sent to their primary email address. To the extent possible, we will try to accomodate high ranked preferences.

These standards are set to accommodate the different priorities of the various internship training rotations. For example, an applicant with 250 intervention hours might be competitive for the neuropsychology rotation but probably would not be competitive for the more intervention-intensive rotations. Similarly, an applicant with 50 assessment hours would not be competitive for the neuropsychology rotation but might be competitive for another one. VA conducts drug screening exams on randomly selected personnel as well as new employees. Interns are not required to be tested prior to beginning work, but once on staff they are subject to random selection for testing as are other employees. Please be advised: Although the recreational and medical use of marijuana is legal in Massachusetts and some other states, it is not legal at federal facilities. Thus, we cannot employ anyone who tests positive for cannabis. For additional information regarding the “VA Drug-Free Workplace Program,” please see https://www.va.gov/OAA/onboarding/VHA_HPTsDrug-FreeWorkplaceOAA_HRA.pdf. Program Description The primary objective of the VA Boston Healthcare System Psychology Internship Program is to provide a comprehensive predoctoral training program that assures the development of adequate levels of proficiency across the basic core competencies of clinical psychology including assessment, behavior change and psychotherapy, consultation, attention to issues of diversity and cultural responsiveness, professional ethics, and scholarly inquiry / clinical research. We view the internship year as critical in the transformation of the individual from graduate student to professional psychologist. We encourage the development of a professional identity, professional values, and a professional demeanor along with these competencies in the practice of psychology. The expectation is that by the end of the training year, an intern will be able to function competently and independently (i.e., entry level practice or better) in the core competencies, listed above. Within the training program, general skills are emphasized. However, when feasible and appropriate to training needs, the development of specialist skills also is encouraged. We provide training in professional psychology in the following rotations for 2024 - 2025: Behavioral Medicine Center for Returning Veterans (OEF/OIF/OND) General Mental Health Geropsychology Neuropsychology Primary Care Behavioral Health PTSD Clinical Team Rehabilitation Psychology Women's Trauma Recovery Team Substance Abuse Treatment at our Brockton Campus Substance Abuse Treatment at our Jamaica Plain Campus Trauma and Addiction Recovery Our rotations are located at the VA Boston Healthcare System - Brockton, Jamaica Plain (Boston), and West Roxbury campuses. Our patient population is diverse and interns will have opportunities to with veterans with diverse identities, including veterans of Color and LGBTQ+ veterans. We encourage applications from trainees committed to culturally responsive and trauma-informed care. Our internship is a member of the Academy of Psychological Clinical Science (APCS) and we also encourage applications from academy graduate programs.

Program Description The Psychology Internship Program at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System is a full-time training experience designed to promote the professional development of interns consonant with current professional and ethical standards. Our model of training is practitioner-scholar. Our Internship Program is committed to providing significant experiences needed to develop conscientious, ethical, and competent psychology professionals capable of providing high quality psychological services. We are equally committed to providing a culturally sensitive and relevant training experience for bilingual (Spanish-English) trainees. We aim at developing psychology professionals not only capable of providing services within traditional lines, but also capable of responding to emerging service delivery trends and professional challenges. Furthermore, we provide a learning environment, within which trainees are treated with courtesy and respect in the context of a collegial relationship with their supervisors and other staff members. We assume the obligation of respecting the interns' right to accessible training staff, close supervision, and support to successfully complete their training. The training model we follow is primarily experiential and has a strong emphasis on practice informed by science. Specifically, we follow a practitioner-scholar training model that seeks to integrate research findings, psychological theory, and practice. Consonant with this model, the program encourages and assists interns to utilize empirical research and to develop critical thinking skills, gain understanding of the scientific literature, and base case conceptualization and clinical interventions on theoretical foundations. The population we serve is primarily Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican and all our documentation is done in the English language. Interns must be capable of providing psychological services fluently in both Spanish and English. Bilingual applicants of diverse backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply.

We recognize that the internship selection process can be very stressful, and we would like to minimize the stress for our applicants. We believe that the expectation of in-person interviews may likely add additional burden for many of our applicants. We remember what it was like to go through the internship selection process (the expense of travel, the stress of flight delays, worries about potential winter weather issues) and we don't want to our current applicants to go through any of this! Also, based upon feedback from our past applicants, we no longer offer optional in-person interviews. Applicants had shared concerns that optional interviews really weren't optional because preference would be given to applicants who had come to our facility in-person. VAEK supervisors will be glad to answer additional questions at any time during the selection process. You are welcome to contact us for information prior to submitting your application and this open door policy extends through the entirety of selection and beyond. We want our applicants to have all the information that they need to make the right decision about internship! Applicants can apply to both the Topeka and Leavenworth campuses, or may select to apply to only one of the two. Selected applicants will be invited to interview separately at each campus. During the interviews, applicants will meet with training supervisors, psychology leaders, and the current cohort of interns. Interviews will occur in early to mid January (exact dates TBD). For the Leavenworth campus, interviews are generally conducted in the afternoons and last 3-4 hours. In Topeka, interviews will start mid-morning and will last approximately 6 hours. Applicants will interview individually and in small groups (2-3 applicants). Requests to meet with specific staff members are welcome. We do our best to schedule times for applicants to meet with ALL rotation supervisors and training staff. Training staff recognize the impact of individual diveristy, to include race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, disability, culture, and gender, across all levels of psychological theory, research, practice, and education. We seek both staff and interns who are strongly committed to diversity and who are supportive of providing a safe and welcoming work and training environment. We encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply to our internship. The training staff at the VAEKHCS are committed to providing a safe and encouraging environment for diverse persons and for the exploration individual diversity issues.

Program Description St. Cloud VA Health Care System (HCS) provides medical care to Veterans from Minnesota, northern Iowa, northwestern Wisconsin, and eastern North and South Dakota. The Health Care System delivers care to more than 39,500 unique patients annually in the Upper Midwest region. Sixty percent of our total Veteran workload is over the age of 66. Our facility also has three Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) located in Alexandria, Brainerd, and Montevideo, Minnesota. Over 11,500 Veterans are enrolled for care in the three CBOCs. Our local facility and surrounding Community-Based Outpatient Clinics serve a large percentage of rural Veterans. Approximately 76% of our enrollees reside in rural areas. The Psychology Internship Program at St. Cloud VA Health Care System is Fully Accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of American Psychological Association (APA). Questions related to the program's accreditation status should be addressed to: APA, Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation, 750 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002-4242; (202) 336-5979; e-mail: apaaccred@apa.org ; Web: www.apa.org/ed/accreditation . Applicants will be notified no later than December 1st regarding invitations for interviews. All interviews will be conducted virtually or by telephone this year. Services include programs such as: the Outpatient Mental Health Clinic, Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI), Psychological Assessment, Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (RRTP), Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Center (PRRC), Acute Psychiatric Inpatient Unit, Outpatient Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Treatment Program, Mental Health Intensive Case Management (MHICM), Homeless Programming, and Vocational Rehabilitation services. Additional mental health services can be found in the Primary and Specialty Medicine and Extended Care Services Lines. The psychology staff work closely with Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) and within Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program (BHIP) teams in the facility. The psychology service staff includes about 30 psychology positions when fully staffed, with clinicians from diverse training backgrounds as well as psychometrists. The primary objective of the Psychology Internship Training Program is to train doctoral level psychology students to function as independent and ethically-minded entry-level professionals who are proficient in the core competencies of applied health service psychology. It is designed to facilitate the integration and consolidation of the prerequisite academic and experiential learning through a full year of supervised training. The Psychology Internship Training Program’s philosophy is based on the scientist-practitioner model, with an emphasis on training in the provision of mental health services in a medical setting. Our training approach emphasizes implementation and promotion of empirically-based treatment modalities and protocols while fostering the psychological flexibility, problem-solving attitudes, and proficiency in individual/cultural differences and diversity needed to apply empirically grounded treatment approaches. We encourage the review of empirical literature to ground and enhance the intern’s professional skills alongside the professional experience of learning from mentors through ongoing supervision and consultation. As scientist-practitioners, we foster an appreciation for the scientific underpinnings of psychology and ethically-based professional decision-making. The Psychology Internship Training Program is focused on providing generalist training in health service psychology in order to ensure the VA has a constant source of well-trained and qualified psychologists. Our program is designed to be grounded in the understanding that a psychologist must be able to demonstrate core foundational and functional competencies prior to specialization. Thus, interns will have a set of shared core experiences, didactics, and seminars that will allow cohesive cohort development, while also providing a range of optional rotations to suit varied training needs and professional aspirations. Interns take an active role in establishing training goals with each supervisor and rotation experience, as well as overarching goals for the training year.

Program Description Our APA Accredited Psychology Internship Training Program concentrates on developing the knowledge, skills, and techniques necessary to function as professional psychologists. We utilize the practitioner/scientist model and focus on providing interns exposure to veteran centered care experiences such as assessment and intervention. Our site is best suited to providing high-quality training in clinical care with an emphasis on intersectionality of diversity factors, collaboration of care with veterans, and valuing interdisciplinary teamwork. Our internship helps interns understand the complexity of veteran care and discussing the ethical scenarios in supervision to best meet their clinical needs. Our program utilizes the tutorial-apprenticeship model. Interns are assigned primary supervisors from members of the Psychology Training Staff and participate directly in the work of their primary supervisor(s). The exact nature of the experience will depend on the supervisor-intern relationship, the skill level of the intern, our veteran population, and the rotation itself. We pride ourselves on the flexibility and individualization of our program to meet both the needs of our underserved rural veteran population and our incoming student’s growth areas. In achieving individualized training objectives, our program requires that each intern demonstrate an intermediate-to-advanced level of professional psychological skills, abilities, proficiencies, competencies, and knowledge in the following areas: a) theories/methods of assessment/diagnosis and effective treatments/interventions; b) theories/methods of consultation, evaluation, and supervision; c) strategies of scholarly inquiry; and d) issues of cultural/individual diversity relevant to the above. The Committee on Accreditation and Program Consultation can be contacted at 750 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002-4242; (202) 336-5979. If you have questions or concerns about meeting our minimum requirements for an interview, please contact Dr. Patricia Smithmyer (she/her/hers; Patricia.Smithmyer@va.gov ) to discuss those concerns directly.

Please see brochure, linked on website, for details about requirements, including selective service, vaccines, drug testing, and background checks. Program Description The VA Long Beach Doctoral I nternship Program has been fully accredited by APA since 1980, with our next site visit in 2029. Our primary goal is to train interns to conduct an array of psychological services in a large VA healthcare system. We currently offer 6 fully-funded intern positions across two different tracks: One slot is designated for a Neuropsychology Track (112912), which offers general psychology training with a special emphasis in neuropsychology. Our remaining five slots will be for our General Track (112911), which follows our traditional model of broad-based training in multiple treatment settings. The generalist training that we provide reflects the population of our medical center and community clinics. We serve primarily adult veterans and some active military service personnel, the majority of whom are male but with a higher percentage of women in younger cohorts. We have been known for our behavioral health training as well as more traditional psychological services, with an increasingly strong emphasis on evidence-based treatments. We accept both clinical and counseling students and no distinction is made between them concerning the content of training experiences. We tailor our internship program to the specific needs and interests of each intern. Interns are able to consider rotation opportunities across the hospital. With the advisement of the Training Director and intern preferences taken into account, interns are assigned rotations from different VA hospital clinics that blend their individual training needs and interests. Interns in the General Track will select four 6-month clinical rotations, with two rotations co-occurring in each half of the year. Interns in the Neuropsychology Track will complete a year-long rotation in the neuropsychology clinic in addition to two 6-month general clinical rotations. Our program follows an apprenticeship model, in which interns work closely with their supervisors. The degree of responsibility afforded the intern depends on their level of experience coming into each rotation, and ideally, increases over the course of the rotation as competency and skill increase. In addition to clinical rotations, interns receive additional generalist training through several programmatic elements, including: (1) Didactic/Case Consultation Seminars with a focus on assessment, evidence-based therapies, provision of supervision, professional development, and diversity, (2) Conducting one comprehensive assessment battery and integrated testing report, (3) Providing supervision to practicum students on at least one psychotherapy case, and (4) an Intern Research or Evaluation Project (optional) . Our program also includes experiences to attend mental health grand rounds and other rotation-specific didactic and interprofessional experiences. We offer up to 10 days of release time to attend VA postdoc interviews, one day for the defense of your dissertation, and another for graduation. Many interns are working hybrid remote/in-person schedules, depending on their assigned rotations, and supervisor and intern preferences. Inpatient rotations typically require the intern to be on campus part-time from the start, in which case, trainees are able to choose whether or not they wish to be on those rotations. The training program brochure is located on our website: Internship Program | VA Long Beach Health Care | Veterans Affairs We recommend checking this website before you come to interview, as items in the brochure are updated often. Please email our Training Director Dr. Leela Farina at leela.farina@va.gov with questions that are not answered in the brochure.

Situated in the heart of West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle in historic Berkeley County, the medical center has a service area of more than 126,000 veterans in West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The towns surrounding Martinsburg are steeped with history and stunning outdoors rich with recreational opportunities. The Appalachian Trail is nearby offering miles of scenic hiking and biking trails to explore. The Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers flow through the area offering opportunities for fishing, kayaking, whitewater rafting and tubing. Overall, the eastern panhandle of West Virginia is a small, friendly community environment with beautiful scenery to enjoy numerous outdoor activities, yet still within a 90 minute drive to the Nation’s Capital. The Psychology Internship Program is grounded in the practitioner-scholar model, which emphasizes that through the training experience clinical practice is guided by scientific theory and research. Based on this model, the development of knowledge and skills related to evidence based treatments are considered critical to competent and ethical professional practice. Interns are trained in evidence based practices and learn how to incorporate these practices in their clinical work across all rotations. The practitioner-scholar model also acknowledges the complexity of real patients and limitations of the empirical base. Thus, science and research are constantly evolving and informed from the delivery of clinical care while respecting our patients as unique people, accounting for individual, cultural, and societal considerations. All interns’ experiences are designed to meet our educational model by ensuring the program’s foundations are based upon the following: high quality supervision; training in empirically based assessment and treatments; a broad range of clinical experiences and didactics; specialized training and experience in an intern’s specific interest area; individualized intern experience based upon intern’s goals and level of prior experience/skills/professional development; and research/scholarly activity/quality improvement opportunities. The training model is competency-based within the practitioner-scholar framework. The internship year is designed to be sequential, cumulative, and graduated in complexity. There will be increased expectations for the interns’ performance in the core competencies as their knowledge, experience, and expertise grow and develop. As the year progresses, interns will be assigned more difficult and complex tasks based upon their level of competency. Initially working under close supervision of experienced and skilled staff members, students will be expected to work with increasing independence as they develop individual competencies. Training will be conducted in a format that encourages growth of the student clinically and professionally throughout his/her time in the program. Supervision is expected to match the needs of the intern in a way that facilitates professional development and progression. Thus, the intensity of supervision diminishes over the course of the rotation and internship as the intern matures into the role of a colleague, rather than a student. It is during this internship program that future psychologists should receive their final formal year of educational and clinical training experience. The program is dedicated to providing a supportive and collegial environment in which interns receive direct supervision to guide them through their journey of personal and professional development. Interns will complete three major rotations of four months in duration and two to three minor rotations of four to six months in duration. Major rotations include Primary Care Mental Health Behavioral Health Integration (PCMHI), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder/Evidence Based Therapy, and Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program (BHIP)/Outpatient Mental Health.

Program Description The Salem VAMC offers a generalist program in clinical psychology with a strong cognitive-behavioral orientation. We adhere to a scientist-practitioner model. The focus of our training programs is TRAINING and we use a developmental model for supervision. Major rotations (4-6 months) occur for approximately 3 days/week. Behavioral Medicine/Primary Care, Substance Use Disorders, Geropsychology, Evidence-Based Psychotherapy/ Mental Health Clinic/ BHIP and PTSD major rotations are elective. We have offered a Neuropsychology Track (Match# 161412) for applicants specifically wanting a Neuropsychology specialization BUT WILL NOT BE OFFERING THIS NEXT YEAR DUE TO STAFFING CHANGES AND MAY NOT HAVE THIS ROTATION AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL TRACK INTERNS. Applicants wanting a strong generalist training are a great fit, as are applicants wanting a generalist background with an emphasis in any of our Major Rotation content areas. Minor rotations are varied in experience and length. Interns spend approximately 1 day/week on their minor rotations. Examples of minors include: Administration, Geropsychology, Military Sexual Trauma, SMI (PRRC), PTSD, Behavioral Medicine, Primary Care Psychology, Substance Use Disorders, Program Development and Evaluation, Assessment, CPT, Residential Groups, Motivational Interviewing, PTSD/SUD, Recovery, and Research. Most interns do three Major and three Minor rotations. A long-term experience is also selected for the entire year. Some options include: DBT, MI/MET, Assessment, Administration, CPT, residential groups, EBP, and PTSD/SUD. We do prioritize interns getting their main area rotations early on in the year to ensure adequate preparation for postdoc and job applications. Historically, our interns have been well-prepared for post-internship positions and routinely secure their first or second choice placements. Although we are a generalist program, we do also adhere to the Houston guidelines for training neuropsychologists and have done an exceptional job preparing neuropsychologists. When available, Neuropsychology applicants may choose to apply to just the Neuropsychology Track or to both tracks. The Neuropsychology Track ensures Neuropsychology Major rotation occurs first rotation and explicit assurance of Houston guidelines being met (again, not available this current year). Extensive didactic trainings are an important component of the internship. Didactics occur weekly for approximately 1.5 hours each week. Seminars on independent practice issues, assessment, ethics and legal issues, working with personality disorders, self-care, EBPs, supervision, motivational interviewing, and professional development. Research is encouraged and publication opportunities are available. Salem is a collegial, warm, and supportive atmosphere. We focus on creating a balanced life, which integrates personal and professional interests and activities. Time is provided weekly to facilitate intern relationships. There is a significant focus on dissertation completion, professional development, and employment search. Our beautiful location in SW Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains offers numerous recreational and cultural activities. Salem is next to Roanoke, Virginia and offers a safe environment, good schools, slower pace of life, great restaurants, and wonderful hiking.

Program Description San Francisco VA Healthcare System (SFVAHCS) offers a wealth of training options for doctoral interns under the supervision of experienced, licensed psychology staff. We stress general training in major practice areas in an integrative theoretical atmosphere as well as an emphasis on scholarly activity and research. Our internship is affiliated with University of California, San Francisco. We offer generalist training across all five intern placements. In addition to our two generalists slots, we offer three tracks where trainees can obtain up to 50% of their clinical time, getting exposure to the following emphasis areas: neuropsychology, health, and geropsychology. Rotation options at SFVAHCS include: Research Placement/Scholarly Project (required); Neuropsychological Assessment; Geropsychology; HIV/Liver, PCMHI, Substance Use Disorders via the Substance Use/PTSD Team or General Addictions Clinics; Behavioral Sleep Medicine; PTSD Treatment Team; Family Therapy Program; General Psych Outpatient Services, Women's Clinic, Severe Mental Illness; Psych Rehab; Inpatient Psychiatry; Primary Care; Group Therapy; and Evidence-based psychotherapies. Seminars and didactic training experiences are built in between SFVAHCS and UCSF. There are opportunities to develop specialty interests in geropsychology, PTSD, substance use disorders treatment, behavioral medicine, and neuropsychological assessment. Our faculty represent a broad range of theoretical orientations and clinical and research backgrounds. Bios are included in our online brochure. Interns may also apply to any of our 7 in-house research and 18 clinical postdoctoral fellowships allowing for multiple years of training at SFVAHCS. Application ratings are based on the applicant's academic work and accomplishments, breadth and quality of previous clinical training (minimum of 1000 hours of practicum required), understanding and skills in psychological assessment, match between our training program and the applicant's needs and interests, letters of recommendation, personal qualities of the applicant (maturity, ethics, responsibility, self-awareness) and organization and clarity of written material. Ultimately, our selection criteria are based on a ""goodness–of–fit"" and we look for interns whose interests and training goals match the training that we offer.

These 5 days do not include additional AA granted for training activities deemed by the Training Director to be part of the Internship training itself (e.g., attending the Nebraska Psychological Association Fall and/or Spring conferences; attending VA-sponsored training elsewhere). Some additional discretionary ""travel-related equivalent time off"" for travel outside of regularly scheduled tour hours can, if granted, be used for specified education-related purposes described in brochure. Brief description of the typical work day for an intern at this training site Interns spend at least 25% of Internship time in direct clinical care which includes both group and individual therapy as well as assessment. The rest of time is spent in supervision, report writing, didactics and other training such as preparing case presentations and didactic presentations plus rotation projects.. The minimum expectation (scheduled tour) is 8:00AM-4:30PM unless prior permission is granted for an alternative schedule. Interns are required to be on site M-F 8-4:30 unless arranged otherwise (40 hours per week). Interns have supervision on various days across the work week. There are two group supervision times common for all Interns to meet with each other and supervisors from several sites; times and weekdays may vary but have included a 90-minute group supervision, and an Assessment Clinic group supervision. Interns also participate in at least 2 hours of individual supervision per week with days based on the schedules of the Intern and their on-site supervisor. Interns spend most of their intervention time with individual patients and depending on training site and rotation (if applicable) may be able to lead or co-lead psychoeducational and evidence-based psychotherapy groups. There is time for therapy documentation and assessment report writing reserved within the schedule. All training sites have the equivalent of day a week (8 hours) devoted to Assessment Clinic which is typically in one full day but can be broken up as needed. The most common communication among Interns (and staff) is via IM, email or face-to-face, with encryption or other security measures when patient information is handled. There is a half-hour for lunch and depending on Intern's schedule often followed by 30-minute protected time for Interns (if they so choose) to text or video-chat with each other across training sites currently via TEAMS. Interns also come together from all 4 training sites virtually via TEAMS for weekly didactics; these are internal to VA NWI and may originate from any of the NWI training sites. In the last 2/3rds of the year there is roughly 3-4 hours per month of Supervision Skills Training time with a focus on hands-on application of supervision skills including the possibility of both peer supervision of real cases as well as role plays of specific skills. There are no longer practicum students at any of our training sites. Does this site have practicum psychology students on site? No Is this program fully affiliated with one or more doctoral programs?

Interviews for all 3 sites will all take place via TEAMS (preferred) or other available virtual platform by special arrangement, with representatives of NWI faculty from most or all of the 3 main training sites in attendance. Interview dates are typically early in January on a Thursday and Friday, with a possible additional day added if needed. The virtual platform available for interviews at our VA will be outlined in the interview invitation; at this point the preferred platform is likely to be TEAMS although this may change and other platforms may also be available.

The NWI Internship currently offers 6 training positions within 3 training tracks across the 3 training sites (Grand Island, Lincoln, Omaha ). The internship begins on Monday July 13, 2026. For the 2026-27 training year, we have 7 training positions across the 3 training sites. All Interns achieve the same profession-wide competencies but have variations in the journey. Two tracks have rotations whereas the others do not, but follow the rotation calendar for the evaluation process. The Grand Island-based Interns spend one day per week in the Assessment Clinic. The other rotations are General Outpatient Mental Health (GMH) and Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) . The Grand Island track includes both individual and group work in the outpatient clinic as well as group work within the residential substance abuse treatment program. The Lincoln-based Intern has three year-long ‘rotations’ – GMH 2 days per week; PTSD 1 day per week; and Assessment Clinic one day per week. The GMH and PTSD training in Lincoln are primarily individual therapy experiences, although some group work may become available. There is an outpatient intensive substance abuse treatment program, and in the past some Interns in Lincoln have participated in the Anger Management group in this program. Provided the Intern is meeting expectations and if sufficient clinical experiences are available, they can request some of their GMH hours to be used within the PCMHI treatment environment. The Omaha VA training structure has 3 potential intervention rotations – one with the PTSD/PCT team, one with the Residential treatment program (RRTP) and the other with the outpatient General Mental Health (GMH) team under a BHIP supervisor. The Omaha-based Interns participate in a year-long Assessment Clinic and shares didactics and group supervision with trainees and supervisors across four training sites. There are possible opportunities for elective experiences in areas such as residential treatment, PCMHI, and whole health. Applicants invited to interview for the six open positions are eligible to rank any or all of the 3 tracks/training sites. All tracks are interviewed on January 6th or 9th (if invited) with participating faculty representing the range of training sites. Each track is ranked separately by both applicant & NWI with a single interview despite using the 3 different Match numbers. This is a single unified Internship program within a Scholar-Practitioner model with the aim of developing competent, well-rounded psychologists prepared for independent practice as “excellent generalists” in rural America. That said, the majority of our trainees have gone on to Post-Doctoral training with others going into entry level jobs. Training is the primary goal of the program, with delivery of patient care in a variety of clinical settings, consultation-liaison services, didactics, and supervision or mentoring as the primary methods of training. Interns work with a variety of Veterans in respect to background, cultures, age, and disabilities, and presenting concerns with a particular emphasis on developing the range of skills relevant to generalist rural practice. The goal is to meet all core competencies as defined by APA including development of core interprofessional competencies to allow graduates to become high functioning members of interprofessional health care teams. The NWI internship site agrees to abide by the APPIC policy that no person at this training facility will solicit, accept, or use any ranking-related information from any intern applicant.

Interns undertake two 6-month rotations. The program provides excellent and intensive experience and supervision in inpatient and outpatient settings. It is the philosophy of the program that an in-depth concentration in selected clinical areas allows for comprehensive training and better prepares interns for independent practice. Interns are provided with a diverse range of training activities including clinical work with patients, didactic instruction, clinical supervision, participation in research projects when available, and mentoring. Attention is given to the sequence and complexity of the learning tasks and interns are guided through their experience, adjusting for level of ability and expertise. Please see brochure for more detailed information about our Internship Program. During the upcoming recruitment season, we will continue to offer two separate tracks: (1) General Clinical and (2) Health. Five positions will be alloted to General Clinical. Two positions will be allotted to Health. While we have had a long tradition of training students in all of the aforementioned areas, we started a separate Health track with our 2024-2025 Intern class. We fin d this gives Interns greater ability to identify preferred rotations prior to the start of the Internship. Please see our brochure for additional information. NOTE: Match number for Standard Clinical Track is 145311. Match number for Clinical Health Track is 145312.

Degree Accepted Ed.D. Degree Not Accepted This institution, department, internship, or postdoctoral program requires trainees to sign a statement about personal behavior and/or religious beliefs as a condition of admission and/or retention in the program: No How to obtain text of statement: Other Requirements: If you are selected as an intern, you will be considered a Federal employee, and the following requirements will apply. 1. U.S. citizenship. VA is unable to consider applications from anyone who is not currently a U.S. citizen. Verification of citizenship is required following selection. All interns and fellows must complete a Certification of Citizenship in the United States prior to beginning VA training. 2. A male applicant born after 12/31/1959 must have registered for the draft by age 26 to be eligible for any US government employment, including selection as a paid VA trainee. Male applicants must sign a pre-appointment Certification Statement for Selective Service Registration before they can be processed into a training program. Exceptions can be granted only by the US Office of Personnel Management; exceptions are very rarely granted. 3. Interns and Fellows are subject to fingerprinting and background checks. Match result and selection decisions are contingent on passing these screens. Please find additional information about the required background checks at the following website (http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/10450.html) 4. VA conducts drug screening exams on randomly selected personnel as well as new employees. Interns and Fellows are not required to be tested prior to beginning work, but once on staff they are subject to random selection for testing as are other employees. 5. To comply with federal and VA rules and provide interns with liability protection, a current and valid Affiliation Agreement between VA and the sponsoring doctoral program must be on file before the intern can be appointed. Most APA-accredited doctoral programs already have an agreement on file. More information is available at Affiliate Resources - Office of Academic Affiliations (va.gov) (see section on psychology internships). 6. Following the match and prior to the start of internship, the Internship Training Director will contact the Directors of Clinical Training (DCTs) for all eight interns. Each DCT for each matched intern will be asked to complete the Trainee Qualifications and Credentials Verification Letter (TQCVL). This document is required for all VA Psychology Internship programs. In essence, this document confirms that you (as a VA Trainee) are in satisfactory physical condition to meet the requirements of the internship program as well as attesting that interns have met appropriate tuberculosis screening as well as other immunization screenings. Such documentation is not uncommon to need prior to working in a healthcare setting. Appointment to the internship cannot happen until this document has been signed by both the intern’s graduate program and senior leadership from the VA North Texas Health Care System. We will work closely with your graduate program to ensure this document is completed in a timely manner. For more information about this document, please see the web address linked here (Trainee Qualifications and Credentials Verification Letter (TQCVL) - Office of Academic Affiliations (va.gov). 7. Matched interns will be required to complete pre-employment documentation prior to the start of internship. These forms include the Application for Health Professions Trainees (VA 10-2850D), the Declaration for Federal Employment (OF 306), and the Health Professions Trainee Random Drug Testing Notification and Acknowledgement Memo. These documents are available online for review (Resources for Health Professions Trainees Coming to VA | Eligibility and Forms - Office of Academic Affiliations). Falsifying any answer on these required Federal documents will result in the inability to appoint an intern or will result in the intern's immediate dismissal from the training program. 8. Health Professions Trainees (HPTs) are appointed as temporary employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs. As such, HPTs are subject to laws, policies, and guidelines posted for VA staff members. There are infrequent times in which this guidance can change during a training year which may create new requirements or responsibilities for HPTs. If employment requirements change during the course of a training year, HPTs will be notified of the change and impact as soon as possible and options provided. The VA Training Director will provide you with the information you need to understand the requirement and reasons for the requirement in timely manner. Please refer to this website for further information: Am I Eligible? Checklist for VA HPTs 9. Most HPTs are subject to random drug testing and must sign a Random Drug Testing Notification and Acknowledgement Memo. For additional information see: VA Drug-Free Workplace Program Guide for Veterans Health Administration Health Professions Trainees. Although medical and recreational use of cannabis is legal in some states, it is prohibited for federal employees and trainees to use cannabis and its derivatives, including CBD, on or off duty, no matter which state they reside. 10. Proof of identity for VA. Onboarding requires two source identification documents (IDs) to prove identity. Documents must be unexpired and names on both documents must match. For more information visit: https://www.oit.va.gov/programs/piv/_media/docs/IDMatrix.pdf Program Description The VA North Texas Health Care System (Dallas VAMC) is the 2nd largest VA health care system in VHA. The Dallas campus is a large General Medical/Surgical hospital with over 1,400,000+ outpatient visits per year. Interns choose 4 rotations from 16 available rotations. Rotation activities include medical/surgical, consultation/Pain Clinic, primary care medicine, primary care mental health, homeless domiciliary, substance abuse treatment, neuropsychology, spinal cord injury, nursing home care, and PTSD (combat and military sexual trauma). The site also offers an APA-accredited Postdoctoral program (7 slots) in ""Clinical Psychology"" with an emphasis in Substance Use Disorders (2 slots), PTSD/SUD (2 slots), Health/Rehab (2 positions), and PTSD, and an independently APA accredited fellowship in Clinical Neuropsychology (2 positions). This program is a member of APPCN as well. On-site interns have been highly considered for these positions. Of the 92 staff psychologists, approximately 40% are available as rotation and on-going psychotherapy supervisors. Supervision is at least 2 hours face-to-face weekly, plus 1 hour weekly from EBP supervisors, and 1 hour of group supervision by the TD. Nearly all past interns have passed licensing exams and have obtained either post-docs or jobs following internship. Interns will receive training in Evidence Based Psychotherapy including CPT, CBT, ACT, IPT, IBCT, and PE and will carry two patients each half or the year, using one EBP (each six months), in addition to rotation work. Over the course of the training year, interns accrue sick leave and annual leave (totaling 13 days of annual leave and 13 days of sick leave), have 11 federal holidays, and have health and life insurance benefits. Time off to defend one's dissertation is provided along with time off to attend APA, Texas Psych Assn., or Dallas Psych. Assn. meetings. The VA North Texas Health Care System's doctoral internship was reaccredited after our site visit in November 2022 for the full 10 years.

We believe that internship training must prepare future psychologists to work as skilled independent practitioners and consultants in multi-specialty and interprofessional teams that include other mental health professionals, primary care physicians, and allied health professionals. We are committed to training generalists with broad clinical and consultation skills. However, we also facilitate the growth of skills in areas of specialization. As such, we provide interns with training experiences that allow them to develop preliminary competencies in specialty areas and prepare them for more intensive post-doctoral education and training. Internship training objectives within all rotations are designed to build upon basic clinical competencies acquired in graduate training. Please visit program website for a more complete description.

The internship program at VA Palo Alto is a member of the Academy of Psychological Clinical Science, a coalition of doctoral training programs and internship sites that share a goal of producing and applying scientific knowledge to the assessment, understanding, and amelioration of human problems. Palo Alto has extensive strengths in training. We have a large staff of distinguished psychologists who represent a broad range of areas of expertise and are dedicated to training and supervision of our future psychology colleagues. Supervision at Palo Alto emphasizes a developmental approach, evidence-based practice, and overall professional development within a supportive, training-focused environment . Palo Alto supervisors represent a range of theoretical orientations, with a preponderance of CBT, “third-wave,” and integrative approaches. Supervisors are highly invested in residents’ professional development and provide a supportive yet challenging training environment. We are committed to providing training that values connection and relationships between supervisors and residents, among team members, and within the internship class. Perhaps more than any other psychology internship program in the nation, Palo Alto has numerous opportunities for training in a wide variety of settings and, therefore, the program is able to offer a training experience individualized to the particular resident's training needs and goals . There are rotations for training in psychological and neuropsychological assessment, and for training in interventions with adults and families in geriatric settings, medically-based settings including primary care and physical rehabilitation, inpatient and outpatient mental health settings, and residential PTSD and substance use treatment settings. There are opportunities to do clinical research or program development and evaluation, either as part of rotations that are primarily clinically-focused, or in rotations that emphasize health services research, program evaluation and implementation/dissemination, or translational research. These experiences are intended to supplement and complement training experiences obtained in your graduate program. Assignment to rotations and selection of supervisors is based primarily on the resident's training needs and interests, and are determined after the Match. The internship year is divided into two six-month periods. Within each 6-month period, residents typically spend half-time at each of two sites. In addition to training assignments, residents have Wednesday afternoons set aside for a year-long internship seminar series. There are multiple other optional didactics available to residents (e.g., training in EBTs, CE conferences, grand rounds, track- and rotation-specific seminars). We believe that psychologists should be prepared to work as members of interprofessional health care teams , interacting collaboratively with the full range of disciplines that provide health care services. Most of our care settings are interprofessional. Residents' professional development is emphasized and supported throughout the year.

The Training Program has a specific mission, as captured in the following statement: "" It is the mission of the Psychology Internship Training Program at the American Lake Division of VA Puget Sound to ensure that Veterans and others across the nation have continuing access to highly qualified, ethical, and professional health service psychologists who integrate science into their practice, with sensitivity to and knowledge about the influence of ethnic, cultural, and individual differences on their psychological services ."" Philosophy It is our belief that excellence in health service psychology requires attention to ethics, diversity, science, and practice. The internship program at American Lake draws from the Scientist-Practitioner model, which requires the integration of science and practice. We believe that interns pursuing a career in clinical work should follow scientifically proven practices, and that those who become researchers should utilize clinical sensitivity and insight in designing and implementing their research. Overview of the Training Program The Doctoral Internship at American Lake provides supervised HSP experience to doctoral candidates in Clinical or Counseling Psychology who are enrolled in programs accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA), the American Psychological Association’s Commission on Accreditation (APA CoA), or another VA recognized accrediting organization (e.g., PCSAS). Aims Our in­tern­ship program's major aims include: Preparation for effective, entry level functioning in complex and comprehensive public service environments. Development of professional identity that includes valuing justice, integrity, respect, and ethical practice. Commitment to the appreciation, generation, and application of scientifically derived knowledge, including the integration of science with practice. Commitment to and respect for individual and cultural diversity. Our aims reflect our belief that a psychologist is defined both by specific training re­ceived and by the attitude with which clinical and research problems are approached. Our aims support the VA’s broader mission of training psychologists competent and committed to practice in public service settings. Our internship program is developed from the basic perspective that a health service psychologist should be broadly trained in accordance with the Profession-Wide Competencies (PWCs) defined by the American Psychological Association. We believe a practitioner must be a generalist before they can be a competent specialist. To that end, our internship training is designed to provide clinical experience across the spectrum of psychological skills, while allowing for some experience in specialty or focus areas and involvement in research. We expect each intern to participate in a range of placements that foster acquisition of PWCs, complement their individual training to date, and further their professional development and career plans. Interns should seek out and be exposed to a wide array of patients and problems and work with a variety of programs and supervisors. Interns are expected to further develop already-acquired PWCs. They are expected to gain experience with patients that represent a cross-section of the diverse Veterans served at VA Puget Sound’s American Lake Division and to acquire sensitivity to and knowledge of cultural differences and other individual differences that influence how services are provided. Emphasis is placed on the experiential (i.e., hands on) acquisition of clinical skills, including the ability to evaluate psychiatric and neuropsychological disorders objectively, to develop and implement treatment plans, and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Didactics addressing relevant clinical, research, and professional concerns occur throughout the year at both Divisions of VA Puget Sound (American Lake, Seattle), and in the greater professional community.

Interns will complete 5 total rotations. There are 2 Core Rotations--one in Psychotherapy and the other in Assessment. Each core rotation lasts six months. In addition to the core rotations, interns will complete 3 elective rotations lasting 4 months each. This structure allows for both breadth and depth of clinical experiences, as well as exposure to a variety of treatment approaches and supervision. The six-month Psychotherapy placement provides interns with the opportunity to provide psychotherapy (individual and group) and receive exposure to evidence based psychotherapy. populations may include Veterans with combat-related PTSD, military sexual trauma, substance use disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and serious and persistent mental illness. The six month Assessment experience involves providing the full range of services associated with psychological, academic, and neuropsychological assessments (intake, testing, scoring, write-up, and feedback provision). Referrals for psychological assessments come from medical, mental health, and other specialty clinics requesting differential diagnosis and treatment planning. Assessments are closely supervised, with interns being exposed to a variety of styles and approaches to psychological assessment. Elective rotations vary annually, we offer anywhere from 8-12 rotations, depending on supervisor availability. Rotations may include: Inpatient Psychiatry, Primary Care Mental Health Integration, Geropsychology, Addictions, Pain Psychology, in patient and outpatient Substance Abuse, PTSD, VITAL (OEF/OIF Veteran outreach in college settings) and Complementarary and Inegrative Health/ Mindfulness, Actute Crisis Team, etc. Within these rotations, interns function as providers, consultants, and members of interprofessional teams. They are exposed to serious psychopathology and complex medical conditions, allowing them ample opportunity to put to use the diagnostic and treatment skills learned in their academic settings. Interns work closely with the training director to prioritize their preferences for rotations based on their training needs, and the training director assists the cohort in creating a plan for the rotations so that each intern can have their preferred rotations or identify suitable alternatives that meet their training goals. Interns are encouraged to plan their year so they can develop the most fundamental competencies, deepen skills and experience in areas aligned with career goals, and to also try new things they may not have tried before.

Program Description The University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry in affiliation with the Psychology Service, VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) and Rady Children's Hospital, offers a 12-month, full-time, APA-accredited predoctoral internship in clinical psychology. The program trains doctoral candidates to function as autonomous professionals in a variety of health care settings, with particular emphasis on the role of the psychologist in a teaching hospital, adult or child outpatient setting, and/or an inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric setting.The program emphasizes the Boulder, Scientist-practitioner model of training in psychology. We particularly welcome applicants who are oriented more toward research and clinical interests (i.e., academic careers). For each intern, the program is comprised of year-long placements in two major rotations. The rotational structure of the program allows interns to maximize their exposure to the experiences available at each site. The possible combination of training opportunities for an intern is fairly unique to this nationally recognized program. Major rotations include adult/child inpatient/outpatient services, eating disorders, behavioral medicine, substance use disorders, mood disorders, PTSD/trauma, TBI, neuropsychology, and serious mental illness. The psychology internship training program is well integrated into the many training programs within the VA and UCSD Department of Psychiatry, affording psychology interns the opportunity to work alongside other trainees including psychiatry and psychology residents and fellows. Our large program affords a myriad of training resources while maintaining a strong sense of community and collaboration as our trainees progress toward independence. The program begins July 1st. Interns have options to join health insurance programs. Most internship graduates go on to post-doctoral fellowships, many in research activities and many in the UCSD/VA San Diego system.

Primary Care Mental Health Integration; 5. Trauma Recovery Servicecs and 6. Women’s Health Clinic. Interns can choose anywhere from 2 to 3 specialty electives throughout the year with a time commitment of 12 hours/week from the following: 1. ACT Clinic (6 months or full year); 2. Couples Therapy Clinic (full year); 3. Research Elective (6 months of full year), and 4. Trauma Recovery Services (full year). The Neuropsychology Track Interns will participate in a full-year clinical placement in the Outpatient Neuropsychology Clinic – 18 hours/week, and both interns will co-facilitate a Memory and Aging Group for the full year (2 hours). The interns will also participate in two additional six-month clinical placements in Geriatrics - 12 hours/week and in the Memory Clinic - 12 hours/week. Each placement includes time for direct patient encounters, supervision, and administrative work/scoring/writing. The Neuropsychology Track Interns will also participate in four hours of didactics per week.

Program Description The VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System is committed to the training of professional psychologists consistent with a practitioner-scholar training model. Within a supportive and collegial atmosphere, we seek to facilitate development of a reflective approach to practice that integrates empirical knowledge and delivery of clinical services. Interns are viewed as making the transition from the student role to the professional colleague role over the course of the training year, honing clinical and communication skills and competencies ultimately required for effective independent practice. Opportunities are offered for continued training in areas of practice with which interns may already be familiar, as well as introduction to assessment strategies, treatment orientations, and other clinical challenges that may be less familiar. At the start of the training year, interns undergo two weeks of orientation to the Mental Health Service and to the medical center. They visit rotation sites and meet with potential supervisors to compose a training experience that best fits their interests and needs. Trainings are provided in areas such as risk assessment; the VA electronic medical records system; diversity and multicultural considerations; principles and general methodology of cognitive behavior therapy and motivational interviewing; military culture, values, and traditions; and other relevant topics. This is also the opportunity to visit each program within the Mental Health Service, which exposes our new interns to the variety of services we offer as well as helping them better define their rotation interests. The Training Director acts as an advocate for interns and the training program within the medical center and Mental Health Service. The Director meets regularly with interns as a group and individually to hear and respond to their training needs and concerns. Our internship offers full-time, generalist training in the practice of professional psychology within a multidisciplinary Veterans Affairs medical center. We accept 4 interns per year. Our program is fully accredited by the American Psychological Association and complies with all standards and regulations of the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC), as well as APPIC Match Policies and Procedures. Wednesdays are devoted to didactics, group supervision and other training activities. The day will include morning Didactic Seminars covering topics such as clinical intervention and assessment, diversity, law and ethics, and a variety of empirically supported treatments. Wednesday afternoons include rotating learning activities focused on professional development, including opportunities for mock interviewing and supervision, as well as rotating experiences such as the Diversity Project, Ethics and Diversity Journal Club, Supervision Theory & Practice Seminar, and Group Supervision. In addition, we offer a Mentor Program, in which interns select a psychologist with whom they can meet individually throughout the year for ongoing support and encouragement and to discuss concerns and professional development issues in a safe, confidential atmosphere. The mentor will not be in an evaluative role with the intern. Vision Statement: “To prepare our psychology interns for long-term success in health service psychology.” Aims: 1. To develop in our interns strong core generalist skills in health service psychology through competency-based supervised training. 2. To prepare interns to function competently within an integrated health care system, particularly the Veterans Health Administration. 3. To support our interns in preparing for the next step in their professional careers.

Please see our website for additional eligibility requirements. Program Description Our program offers 3 tracks: The PTSD Track (APPIC Number: 234211) consists of one position. The PTSD Program offers an interdisciplinary training environment where interns refine skills in the areas of individual and group therapy, assessment, case conceptualization, and treatment planning. This rotation provides interns with a foundation in trauma and specialized skills in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. The PTSD program was developed to treat Veterans experiencing PTSD from all sources of trauma. Veterans are fully assessed by clinicians to determine program eligibility and treatment needs. The PTSD Program is developed to provide evidence-based treatments that include PE, CPT, or EMDR. Additional groups following the initial course of treatment focus on the Veteran's specific needs. There are core groups for Veterans experiencing combat trauma, military sexual trauma, and guilt and shame related to traumatic experiences. Clinical experience is gained throughout three 12-month placements. This rotation system is designed to provide opportunities in PTSD as the area of emphasis, generalist training, and a minor rotation in psychodiagnositic assessment. The Neuropsychology Track (APPIC Number: 234212) consists of one position. It is ideal for applicants with prior experience in neuropsychology who plan to pursue a neuropsychology postdoctoral fellowship. Training is designed to meet the Minnesota Conference Guidelines. The intern is expected to devote at least 50% of their time to activities designed to increase knowledge of brain-behavior relationships and neuropsychological assessment. The neuropsychology intern is guaranteed 12-month placement in the neuropsychology clinic and geriatric evaluation clinic. The intern will also receive 6-month generalist training in the PCBH and HBPC/Palliative Care rotations and will be required to utilize evidence based treatments during the year. They are required to participate in the neuropsychology seminar. The training builds on competencies in the Minnesota Conference Guidelines including foundational competencies (e.g., neuroscience of brain behavior relationships, integration of science and practice, etc.) and functional competencies (e.g., assessment, intervention, consultation, and professional/ scholarly activities, etc.). The Geropsychology Track (APPIC Number: 234213) consists of one position. It is ideal for applicants with prior experience in geropsychology who plan to pursue a geropsychology postdoctoral fellowship. The geropsychology track offers a major area of study in geropsychology where the intern will spend at least 50% of their time involved in activities designed to increase their knowledge and skills in providing care to older adults. The geropsychology track intern is guaranteed placement in the geriatric evaluation clinic, neuropsychology clinic, and HBPC/Palliative care rotations. They will also receive generalist training in the PCBH rotation and will be required to utilize evidence based treatments during the year. They are required to participate in the neuropsychology seminar. The training builds on the Pikes Peak Competency areas for Geropsychology Training. This includes both foundational knowledge of aging and functional competencies (i.e., assessment, intervention, and consultation). The VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System (VASNHS) internship was developed to address community and Veteran Health Administration needs within the greater Las Vegas Metropolitan area with respect to recruiting and training new psychologists. VASNHS is steadfast in its commitment to providing high quality training to psychology interns with emphasis toward preparation in public sector careers. At VASNHS, the internship year is conceptualized as a set of clinical and professional skills that interlock. The internship training year includes intensive clinical training under the supervision of licensed psychologists. Interns will work within dynamic intercollaborative professional teams consisting of medical and allied health professions. Training at the VASNHS is crafted to expand and enhance professional psychology competencies. The program trains doctoral candidates to function as autonomous professionals in varied health care settings, with emphasis on the role of the psychologist in state of the art medical settings. Our program seeks to deliver a strong foundation in fundamental and advanced practice skills within an area of emphasis while also providing strong generalist training. The acquisition of core competencies in evidence-based approaches to care is paramount. Training is experiential, supervised, and graded in complexity. Learning is a developmental and sequential process leading toward the ultimate goal of independent practice. The Psychology Internship Program is designed to promote professional competency and engender skills in complex clinical reasoning.

Our health care system includes two main campuses and several community-based facilities within St. Louis and the surrounding metro areas. Nearly all of our training rotations offer experiences within multidisciplinary teams. The internship year is divided into two, 6-month semesters. Each semester consists of two rotations that run the entire 6 month period. Each rotation meets two days per week. The fifth day of each week (Friday) is dedicated to didactic trainings and dedicated time for independent training activities tailored to meet the unique needs and interests of interns. Neuropsychology track interns spend their first semester of training in neuropsychology and neurorehabilitation clinics. Interns attend all of our Psychology Grand Rounds and Psychology Service meetings and many participate in psychology service councils or hospital committees. Didactics include case presentations and intern-selected special topics. Enrichment seminars are multi-week learning opportunies that focus on instruction in areas relevant to APA CoA's profession-wide competencies. We have 5 general internship positions and 1 neuropsychology track position. We offer optional emphasis areas of training in Health Psychology and Geropsychology. Health psychology rotations include Spinal Cord Injury, Primary Care Mental Health Care Integration, and Siteman Cancer Center (pending OAA approval for 2026-27 training year). Geropsychology rotations include Community Living Center and Palliative Care. We also offer rotations in the Inpatient Mental Health, the Substance Abuse Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program, and the Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program. Each year there may be some additional opportunities available based upon staffing/availability. Our interns usually find ways to get additional training experiences based upon their interests. Please ask if there is an experience you do not see listed! Our psychology staff works within a collegial environment where relationships and leadership are valued. Supervision is viewed to be a developmental process whereby interns are supported and challenged toward achieving benchmarks in competencies recommended by APA. All of our psychology supervisors are licensed doctoral psychologists. We are looking for accomplished intern applicants who are enthusiastic about training within the VA system and providing care to Veterans.

There are two separate tracks - General and Neuropsychology. VA TVHS interns will have specific clinical experiences and didactics to prepare them for a career in a VA healthcare system. Interns will have the opportunity to work in VA specific clinical settings, such as Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI), Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Programs (BHIP), and the MOVE! program; while similar models of care may be available in the community, these specific models have been developed especially for the VA and are relatively consistent across VA systems. Additionally, VA TVHS interns will participate in didactics which are focused on VA recognized Evidence Based Psychotherapies (EBPs), VA practice guidelines, and leadership potential within the VA healthcare system. Supervisors will be working from the lens of preparing future VA psychologists when evaluating interns on the specific objectives on the VA TVHS Psychology Internship Evaluation Form.

Program Description The Psychology Internship Program at the VA Texas Valley Coastal Bend Health Care System offers 2 General Psychology and 2 Health Psychology internship positions to US citizens who are pursuing a doctoral degree in clinical or counseling psychology. Our philosophy is that all practicing psychologists should have a solid foundation in Health Service Psychology, including the ability to apply empirical data to clinical procedures. Within this framework, the Psychology Internship Program provides a well-rounded year of training in Health Service Psychology and evidence-based practice. All Interns are required to obtain general training in a variety of assessments and interventions across an array of Veteran populations. Rotations are designed to enable broad exposure to various diagnostic, cultural, and age groups complemented by brief training experiences which allow for more focused training in the Intern's area of interest. Major rotations are currently available in Outpatient Mental Health, Substance Abuse Treatment Program, Primary Care Mental Health Integration, and Trauma Treatment. Additional minor rotations in Tele mental Health, Cognitive Processing Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Administration, Suicide Prevention, Health Behavior and Promotion, Community-Based Recovery for Serious Mental Illness, and Bilingual Clinical Services are also currently available. The VA Texas Valley Coastal Bend serves the 20 southern-most counties in Texas, 80% of which are Rural, providing a unique experience in rural mental health with a diverse population.

The aim of the program is to prepare interns for successful entry into postdoctoral or entry-level professional positions, particularly in VA Medical Centers or academic medical centers, and eventual licensure. We accept applications from students who are enrolled and in good standing at doctoral programs in clinical or counseling psychology accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA) or the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA), doctoral programs in Clinical Science accredited by the Psychological Clinical Science Accreditation System (PCSAS), or an APA or CPA-accredited respecialization training program in Clinical or Counseling Psychology. The internship is geared to provide direct clinical experience with adult U.S. military Veterans in outpatient and inpatient mental health and medical settings. This full-tme, 12-month program begins on July 13, 2026 and is organized into three approximately 17-week clinical rotations. There are 8 internship positions, with 5 positions in the General Track and 3 that are funded through Geropsychology. Interns in the Geropsychology track complete two of their three rotations in geriatrics (Geropsychology and Geriatric Medicine), and if interested Neuropsychology. Major rotations include: Behavioral Health; the Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation and Treatment Program; Geriatric Medicine; Geropsychology; Neuropsychology (only open to Geropsychology track unless there is an opening and significant prior training); Anxiety Disorders Clinic; the Substance Use Disorders Outpatient Program; and the Trauma Programs. Selection of rotations is based on the intern's interests, goals, and gaps in training. In addition to the three clinical rotations, interns participate in a year-long psychotherapy placement. The psychotherapy placement is designed to provide interns with a more intensive training experience within a particular treatment model or orientation with patients who present with more complex problems. Interns are required to treat two ongoing patients in the psychotherapy placement. A single ""case"" may be year-long treatment of one individual, an ongoing group, or a series of individual patients who may benefit from more prolonged, but not year-long treatment. There are rich opportunities for education and research. A weekly Intern Seminar, a monthly seminar on Evidence-Based Psychotherapy, and a monthly seminar on clinical supervision are offered during the year. The monthly Geropsychology Journal Club is required for interns in the Geropsychology Track and optional for those in the General Track. In addition to these required didactics, there are many additional learning opportunities, including a weekly Trauma seminar, a weekly GLA Neuropsychology seminar (offered through the Sepulveda VA), a weekly Pain Lecture Series, Psychology Department workshops, GLA/VA-sponsored events, and rotation-specific rounds, lectures, and conferences. Interns are required to become involved in a research or other scholarly project consistent with their interests. Interns are allotted a maxium of four hours of research time per week. While completion of the VA research project is to be the primary use of the intern’s research time, research hours may also be used for any outside research, including completion of the dissertation, preparation of manuscripts or presentations, or work on other research projects. Research hours must be taken on site. Awareness and understanding of diversity and individual differences are crucial to professional development, practice, and research, and we strive to integrate these into every aspect of our training program. Our model for practicing diversity includes awareness of one’s own beliefs, assumptions, values and socio-cultural identity, awareness of and sensitivity to others’, and a working understanding of how these intersect in the therapeutic relationship and institutional environment. The training program is committed to helping trainees cultivate cultural humility, while expanding upon their skills in providing culturally responsive care to various patient populations across WLA. Additionally, the training program actively supports trainees to develop competencies related to advocacy within the larger healthcare system. Please see our program brochure for additional details.

We emphasize a scholar-practitioner model with a focus upon the clinical application of psychology that is informed by science and grounded in the needs of the local community. This approach is ideal for applicants with a strong clinical background, appreciation for the thoughtful application of research and interest in the influence of local, contextual factors. Applicants who are interested in a) pursuing a clinical career in the VA system and/or in a rural setting, b) learning evidence-based practice and c) looking for a small, friendly and close-knit training atmosphere will likely feel the WCHCS internship program is a good fit for them. We aim to maintain a welcoming training environment that values cultural and individual differences. All things being equal, consideration is given to applicants who identify themselves as Veterans or members of historically underrepresented / disadvantaged groups. We strongly encourage students from diverse backgrounds to apply. The program funds three internship positions. The program is a 12-month, full-time appointment. Interns work 40 hours per week. All interns complete a total of 2080 hours of training, which is a VA requirement.

Degree Not Accepted This institution, department, internship, or postdoctoral program requires trainees to sign a statement about personal behavior and/or religious beliefs as a condition of admission and/or retention in the program: No How to obtain text of statement: Other Requirements: The applicant must pass a criminal background check. This will be performed after Match Day and before the first day of employment. The standard background check consists of a criminal check (including both county and federal levels) as well as a social security check. If a background check is communicated as “met criteria,” then this means that there are no criminal records present, or it has met the requirements of the university. If a background check has returned with criminal records present, it goes through a review committee to determine if the individual is eligible to move forward with employment. The review committee has specific criteria that they look for, such as severity of the charge(s), length of time that’s passed, repetitive charges, etc. The applicants may also access their background checks through their account in the vendor’s website. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to our HR Pre-Employment Background Check team at pebc@vanderbilt.edu. Employment as a doctoral intern is contingent on passing the background check. No prospective intern has ever been refused employment as a result of the background check, but it is a possibility. For further context, several prospective interns have had difficulty and in all cases the difficulty was related to past legal problems that were not disclosed during the application process. Program Description Vanderbilt’s University Counseling Center (UCC) is a highly utilized campus support resource that serves about 22-25% of the Vanderbilt student population. The large number of clients who seek services at the UCC afford interns diverse clinical opportunities in terms of culture, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, and level of acuity. As a multidisciplinary setting, the center staff include psychologists, licensed counselors, clinical social workers, psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners and a nurse. Our multidisciplinary staff and close affiliation with numerous campus offices provides interns many opportunities for inter-professional consultation. Additionally, given that the Center has other training programs, including a cinical practicum training program, the provision of supervision is another experiential learning activity in which interns are engaged. When combined with the numerous licensed staff members who participate in internship training and the many experiential activities associated with training (individual and group psychotherapy, psychological assessment, outreach & consultation, crisis response, diagnostic interviewing and intake report writing), the Vanderbilt UCC provides a rich training environment for doctoral interns. Interns are involved in virtually all aspects of clinical service and are considered essential in fulfilling the Center’s mission of assisting students in need and fostering both personal and professional growth. While still in training and under consistent supervision, UCC interns are viewed as colleagues-in-the-making and, as such, they are challenged with managing complex therapy caseloads, assessment cases, and responding to campus events. The training opportunities for interns are broad in range and involve psychotherapy (individual and group), supervision (receiving and providing), conducting initial interviews and generating intake reports, preparing and presenting outreach, participating in crisis response/intervention, and training in various forms of assessment (neurodevelopmental and other mental health disorders). While the internship affords enough flexibility to pursue particular interests (e.g., therapy with specific populations and training in specific treatment modalities), UCC interns participate in the same core activities. Center interns work very hard and their efforts and skill have a direct impact on the Vanderbilt community they serve. The UCC does not have session limits and adheres to a ""generalist” model of training. As a result, there are opportunities for interns to gain a wide range of experiences with treatment of various presenting concerns. All interns are also required to complete a minimum of four integrated psychological assessment over the course of the training year. Interns discuss with the Training Director their goals for the internship training year, and efforts are made to ensure exposure to populations and treatment modalities to help interns realize these goals.

Interns engage in direct individual and group service, individual and group supervision, didactic seminar training, and supervision experience with our practicum students. Interns will conduct individual therapy for about 50% of their training experience. They will have the opportunity to work with a diversity of people aged 12-70. Interns will work with people of all ethnic, SES, religious, sexual orientations, and gender identities during their time at Vantage Point. They can expect to carry a total client caseload of around 22-28 clients. Therapy at Vantage Point tends to be longer term and is determined by presenting problem and discussions with supervisors and clients as to the best needs of the client. Therefore, treatment can be time-limited or longer term. The internship application review committee is looking for the following in qualified interns: 1. Breadth of clinical experience with a diverse clientele 2. Various clinical and training activities, including coursework and/or experience in Assessment, Counseling and Psychotherapy Theories and Practices, Group Counseling, Multicultural and Diversity Counseling, and Supervision. 3.

Program Description The VA New Jersey Health Care System is comprised of 2 medical centers, 20 miles apart (East Orange & Lyons), plus several outpatient clinics and Veterans Centers. Our population is diverse with respect to ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. Comprehensive mental health services are provided to veterans in areas such as acute psychiatry, outpatient mental health, long-term psychiatric rehabilitation and recovery, geropsychology, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, military sexual trauma, primary care, behavioral medicine including oncology, and health psychology. Training rotations are offered at the 2 medical centers and the Bloomfield Veterans Center. They are typically six months in duration with opportunities for 1-3 clinical assignments within each rotation. Concentration in areas of clinical interest may be possible. We employ a practitioner-scholar model. Our training program exposes interns to the scientific principles of practice through readings, seminars, and supervision. Our rotation supervisors offer diverse perspectives, including psychodynamic, CBT, ACT, Mindfulness, integrative, & evidence-based approaches. Rotations and clinical activities are determined by the intern’s level of training and skill, with a progressive increase in complexity of cases and level of autonomy as competence is demonstrated. Supervised instruction is offered in the use of various assessment measures including cognitive, personality, and neuropsychological instruments. Interns develop increased competency in writing comprehensive, integrated psychological reports. In support of the program's clinical and academic aims, we offer a series of well-developed seminars one full day per week. Interns develop advanced competencies in the 9 Profession Wide Competencies required by APA including intervention (group & individual), assessment, multicultural & individual diversity, ethics, legal standards, professional conduct, supervision, consultation/interprofessional collaborative care, and professional issues. Please review our brochure for the specific details of rotations, seminars, and the structure and philosophy of our large, well-developed training program.

We expect applicants to have had previous practicum training in psychotherapy and assessment, including basic proficiency in the administration and interpretation of a variety of assessment tools. Program Description Training general adult practitioners is the primary purpose of the Manhattan VA psychology internship program. Our internship training emphasizes the basic clinical principles and skills essential to the ethical and competent practice of health service psychology. We provide interns with a broad range of experiences in assessment, intervention, and consultation with a variety of patients in medical and mental health settings. Training is informed by scientific inquiry, critical thinking, and active learning. Our program consists of 3 major rotations (4 mos. each) in Acute Inpatient Psychiatry, Health Psychology/Primary Care, and PTSD. Half of interns' time is spent on the major rotation. The rest of their time is comprised of ongoing, year-long assignments psychodynamic psychotherapy, CBT, evidence-based therapies for PTSD, Emotion-Focused Therapy for couples, and group psychotherapy. Interns will also complete a 4-month rotation in Multicultural Consultation & Peer Supervision and a 4-month rotation in neuropsychological assessment where they will have the opportunity to conduct both comprehensive assessments as well as brief cognitive screenings as part of the medical center's multidisciplinary Memory Disorders Clinic. The various clinical training assignments are enhanced by a diverse program of supervision, seminars, and peer review presentations within the VA, as well as at neighboring institutions such as Bellevue and NYU Medical Center. Interns receive intensive supervision (both individual and group) for each rotation and training experience (5-6 hours per week). Our program uses an apprenticeship method of training, providing opportunities for interns to work side by side with supervisors. We also make every effort to foster each intern's creativity, growth, and autonomy. Interns carry their own cases and participate in interdisciplinary team meetings and peer review presentations independently and with their supervisors. Supervisors utilize a variety of treatment orientations and approaches, including: psychodynamic, supportive, CBT, DBT, CPT, PE, STAIR, systems, and eclectic modalities.

Our program is a member of the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) and was awarded full accreditation the American Psychological Association on April 7, 2019. Setting and Presence of Psychology: The Greenville VA Health Care Center opened in March 2014 and was launched to better serve the health care needs of Veterans in the rural counties surrounding the city of Greenville, NC. The Greenville VA Health Care Center is housed in an 116,000-square-foot clinic. Services provided include primary care, mental health, women’s health, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, cardiology, orthopedics, neurology, audiology, optometry, and dental services. Faculty also maintain strong ties with psychology faculty at East Carolina University’s accredited Ph.D. clinical psychology program and ECU’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine. The staff is committed to a scientific approach to the practice of psychology and values training and trainees. We are also committed to ensuring a range of diversity among our training classes with respect to Veteran status, members of historically underrepresented groups, sexual orientation, and disability status. Training Model and Philosophy: We provide training in and encourage the use of evidence-based psychological practice. Our developmental training model emphasizes the progression from graduate student to professional ready for entry-level independent practice in psychology. The primary focus of the internship year is graduated experiential learning. Competencies in professional practice are developed through clinical practice, supervision, didactic training and mentorship. Delivery of patient care is secondary to the educational mission of the internship. Interns play an important role in selecting their own training opportunities and developing training plans to meet their specific needs Program Goals & Objectives: The overarching goal of the VA Greenville Health Care Center training program is to provide generalist training to prepare interns for practice as health service psychologists. The importance of practice that has its foundation in the science of psychology is stressed. The program formally integrates science and practice in a number of ways including didactic seminars on practice issues that are based on current empirical literature and the use of empirically validated and supported assessment and clinical interventions. Our goals are consistent with the VA’s mission to provide quality care to veterans while advancing state of the art services through research and education. Our program has nine primary goals. Interns are expected to develop entry-level competency in the following profession-wide competency areas: Research Ethical and legal standards Individual and cultural diversity Professional values, attitudes, and behaviors Communication and interpersonal skills Assessment Intervention Supervision Consultation and interprofessional/interdisciplinary skills The training year is divided into two six-month terms. Over the course of a six-month term, interns are involved in a primary rotation three days a week and in a secondary rotation one day a week. Trainees with a background in health psychology may be able to choose two health psychology secondary rotations a term (one onsite, one offsite). Please note, rotations available may change based on staff availability. Primary rotation : General Mental Health Secondary rotations : Health Psychology (ECU Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine) Consultation and Liaison Service (ECU Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, located at ECU Medical Center) ECU Brody School of Medicine Family Practice (supervision focus) Primary Care - Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI; integrated behavioral healthcare) onsite at the VA Virtual PTSD Team, onsite at the VA Area: Greenville, North Carolina is widely recognized as the cultural, educational, economic, and medical hub of Eastern North Carolina. While retaining its Southern charm, Greenville has grown into the 12th largest city in the state and is now a thriving, small metropolitan city of about 90,000 in the heart of Pitt County with its own diverse art, music, food, and festival scene featuring an increasing number of unique, locally-owned businesses, galleries, shops, and restaurants. Please note that our training program was inactive for the training years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 in order to recruit and retrain new staff. Our program is now prepared and excited to re-engage in training tomorrow's psychologists.

Interns will typically work on clinical rotations on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Our seminars, didactics, and group supervision are concentrated on Thursdays. Interns have private offices, their own laptop computers, and phone extensions which facilitates managing their clinical schedules and working efficiently. In line with current policy for federal employees, telework for interns is currently limited to ad hoc telework for weather and safety or as part of a reasonable accommodation. Most clinical activities take place in the Mental Health building. Exceptions include: Primary Care Mental Health Integration, which is housed in the Primary Care clinics; the Home-Based Primary Care rotation, which involves travel to Veterans' homes with a supervisor; and the Substance Abuse Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program which is in a separate building a few hundred yards away. Interns are provided ample supervision that is scheduled in coordination with clinical supervisors. Interns typically tell us that they have more than adequate time to complete paperwork and report writing. Neuropsychology interns, in particular, have protected time for writing reports.

We will also consider applicants who already hold a doctorate and are participating in a formal re-specialization program that is accredited by APA or CPA. Applicants who are between the ages of 18 and 25 and who were born male must be registered with the selective service. All VA employees, including interns, are subject to fingerprinting, background checks, random drug screening, and VA flu and COVID vaccination policy. Program Description The Psychology Internship at VHSO is a full-time, one year internship with full APA accreditation. Our internship setting is a comprehensive VA Medical Center that includes a 73 bed hospital with a psychiatric ward, primary care clinics, and diverse outpatient clinics including optometry, dentistry, audiology, speech pathology, and—of course—mental health. Our training calendar is built around three trimesters of four months each. Our internship year will begin on the second Monday in July. Applicants should indicate their preferred focus of training--Trauma Recovery (PTSD treatment), Neuropsychology, or Primary Care-Mental Health Integration--in their cover letter. Interns will generally work in their chosen area of focus throughout the training year. They will also complete minor rotations that may be arranged for one or more trimesters each. Minor rotations are assigned according to the interests, abilities, and training needs of the interns, as well as the training capacity of the minor rotations. The training experiences offered as major rotations/foci (i.e., Trauma Recovery Program, Neuropsychology, and PCMHI) are generally also available as minor rotations, though the experience offered as a minor rotation will obviously be less in-depth than it is when training on that rotation throughout the year. We also have training opportunities that are available only as minor rotations, such as our inpatient Substance Use Disorder program, Home Based Primary Care, and our Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program (aka General Mental Health). We are working to develop additional minor rotations, and hope to be able to discuss these at our interview days. Experience leading group therapy is available through General Mental Health, the PTSD clinic, the Substance Use Disorder program, and sometimes as part of the Neuropsychology clinic. Assignment of rotations is a flexible process, reflecting our belief that training is at its best when it is a collaborative process that honors both the faculty’s and intern’s understanding of the intern’s aspirations and training needs.

VIP programs include: the VIP Community Mental Health Center, Inc.(VIP-CMHC); the Community-Based Assessment and Treatment Center (CATC); the Sexual Assault Center; a 24-Hour Domestic Violence and Crisis Response Team; the Pediatric Extended Care Center/Mental Health “eCARE” ; the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Clinic; the Adult Protection Team; and the Los Angeles County Elder Abuse Forensic Center. VIP focuses on intervention, treatment and prevention, and functions as a public-private partnership that includes the LAC+USC Medical Center where the LAC+USC VIP HUB is located. This HUB is the largest in the County of Los Angeles, and according to Los Angeles County 2008-2009 Civil Grand Jury, representing more than three times as many children as Los Angeles County’s next largest HUB. The VIP HUB is the only HUB open 24/7 and supported by satellite services in East San Gabriel Valley. The HUB currently provides medical and mental health assessments as a collaborative between DHS, DCFS and VIP-CMHC funded through a contract with DMH. The VIP-CMHC was opened thirteen years ago as an independent nonprofit agency to provide comprehensive mental health and support services for child victims and their nonoffending family members. It provides individual, group, and family therapy; developmental screening and referrals; psychological assessments and testing; case management and assistance with housing and basic needs; health and parenting education; academic advocacy; mentoring and tutoring; and therapeutic arts and crafts activities. All services are bilingual and multicultural. VIP-CMHC is incorporated as a 501(c)3 exempt nonprofit corporation, and is governed by a seven member volunteer Board of Directors that provides fiscal oversight, resource development, and professional expertise. The primary goal of the pre-doctoral internship is to provide comprehensive training leading to competency as a practicing psychologist. All of the didactic and experiential components of this program have been developed to allow interns to assume increasing responsibilities as they move towards greater autonomy over the internship course. Thus, the program fosters the development of professional competencies as well as professional identity as a psychologist. The program also fosters the development of multicultural competence. The VIP serves an estimated 20,000 victims of violence each year. Approximately 88% are Latino, 4% African American, 4% Caucasian, 2% Asian, and 2% other. The VIP draws a majority of clients from the neighborhoods surrounding LAC+USC Medical Center, victims and service providers from all over the County rely on the VIP’s continuous and comprehensive intervention and treatment services. The internship provides supervised clinical and didactic experiences with a particular emphasis on fostering multicultural competence and a deep grounding in ethical principles. Each intern is expected to develop strong clinical skills with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds and gain a secure sense of self as a competent and ethical psychology professional. Interns also gain experience in outreach and consultation. The internship is based on the practitioner-scholar model. The program values experiential learning with formal supervision as well as informal opportunities to consult with staff as needed. The internship program also values research and critical thinking skills, and interns are encouraged to integrate recent research into their work and to learn about and employ empirically-based practices. The training program also values collaboration and consultation, and interns are invited and encouraged to foster collaborative relationships with all members of the staff.

Program Description Virginia Beach City Public Schools (VBCPS) is a large (64,000 students), urban/suburban school district in southeast Virginia bordering the Atlantic Ocean. VBCPS Psychological Services staff (licensed clinical and school psychologists) provide internship training and supervision within a general track integrating school and clinical services. Doctoral interns are provided comprehensive training experiences, educational didactic seminars, and extensive supervision to develop and refine their clinical skills, leadership, self-management, and professional identity. The doctoral internship program provides a full-time, 2,000-hour training experience which runs from July 1 - June 30. Core rotations . Doctoral interns are paired together at their core rotations to promote collegiality and to foster skill development. They are assigned two schools, either an elementary school and a secondary school (middle or high) or two elementary schools, where they provide comprehensive psychological services (assessment, intervention/therapy, consultation, crisis intervention, etc.) under supervision. All doctoral interns receive training and experience at both the elementary and secondary levels. Additionally, doctoral interns may have the opportunity to work with preschool-aged children either from their assignment at elementary schools with pre-kindergarten general education classrooms, Early Childhood Special Education (ECSE) classrooms, and/or assignment with the Preschool Assessment Center (PAC) supplemental rotation. Supplemental rotations . Supplemental rotations are an adjunct to the comprehensive training experiences at the core rotations of elementary and secondary school assignments. Supplemental rotations offer doctoral interns more specialized experiences working with students who present with moderate to severe behavioral/emotional issues and/or mental health disorders. Additional supplemental rotation experiences are based on doctoral interns' interests and professional goals along with the district needs. Supplemental rotations are briefly described below. Autism Assessment Team includes ADOS-2 administration and scoring, as well as the opportunity to serve (along with the autism team school psychologist) on the Special Education Committee for the Southeastern Cooperative Education Program’s Autism Spectrum Program (SECEP-ASP), a special education placement for students with ASD who need a more restrictive setting. Doctoral intern(s) completing the Autism Assessment Team rotation possess prior training and experience with the ADOS-2. BASE Program is an intensive, short-term intervention for general education elementary students displaying social skills deficits, emotional dysregulation, and/or behavioral difficulties interfering with their ability to make progress in their current educational setting. Preschool Assessment Center provides screening, testing, and program planning for children between two and five years of age in the community who are suspected of having speech/language delays, developmental delays, and/or developmental disorder. Southeastern Cooperative Education Programs (SECEP) offers a Re-Education of Children Program (Re-ED), which is an alternative program for students who are identified as having an emotional disability and who have been unable to maintain appropriate behavioral control in previous placements. Supportive Therapeutic Educational Program (STEP) is designed to provide individualized academic instruction and intensive therapeutic services to students at the elementary, middle, and high school levels with severe emotional disabilities and mental health disorders. Training and Supervision . Experience with a wide range of clinical disorders is provided and may include students with learning disorders; neurodiverse disorders (ASD); ADHD; intellectual disabilities; post traumatic stress disorders; anxiety, depression, and mood disorders; adjustment disorders (e.g., parental military deployment, foster care placement); schizophrenia, hearing and visual impairments; medical and neurological disorders. Doctoral interns meet for weekly didactic seminars and group supervision, as well as participate in candid conversations on individual and cultural diversity. Doctoral interns are assigned a licensed clinical psychologist as their primary supervisor who provides weekly individual supervision. Additional supervision is provided at the intern's assigned rotation sites by licensed staff working within those programs. Resources and support. Doctoral interns are also provided collaborative work space with one another to promote collegiality. They are also provided electronic devices (laptops, iPads for online assessment), office associate support, and access to a comprehensive assessment library within Psychological Servcies and to an extensive training resource library dedictated to internship training.

Program Description The doctoral internship in health service psychology offered at Cook Counseling Center at Virginia Tech provides excellent preparation for generalist, entry-level psychologists who wish to pursue a career in a university counseling center, or in other outpatient services such as community mental health and private practice. The training program follows a practitioner-scholar model of psychology training that emphasizes the practice of counseling and psychotherapy informed by scientific and scholarly inquiry. To this end, the training program employs a variety of modalities that include a structured and sequenced seminar series, experiential activities, and supervised clinical experiences intended to promote the acquisition of practice skills as well as the development of critical thinking. Interns are encouraged to engage in applied research focusing on addressing questions directly suggested by experiences encountered in clinical practice. Interns are also encouraged to be critical, informed consumers of research with an eye toward clinical applications of scientific findings. Cook Counseling Center provides an environment that is both supportive and challenging to interns as they acquire new skills and reach new levels of personal and professional growth. Interns are seen as emerging professionals and are included in most staff activities. Interns have many opportunities to consult with senior staff, and quality of supervision is emphasized by interns receiving a minimum of 4 hours of supervision per week. The training program espouses a developmental philosophy with the intent to encourage intern growth and development over the course of the training year in domains relevant to the professional practice of psychology. As such, supervisors strive to assess the interns’ beginning levels of competencies in domains relevant to professional practice and work toward growth in these areas over the course of the internship year.

Program Description WCCHC is a Federally Qualified Health Center on Oahu, which offers comprehensive care to a medically underserved community. Our patients are predominantly of Native Hawaiian ancestry, and many have traditional ideologies and values. Interns provide assessment and treatment for a wide range of acute, chronic, and severe psychological and/or organic conditions for patients of all ages. Our main campus main is located in Waianae, with satellite clinics in Nanakuli, Kapolei, Waipahu, Ewa, and the school system. Services provided include primary care, pediatrics, obstetrics, chronic pain management, dentistry, preventative health, emergency medicine (with a 24-hour ER), traditional Native Hawaiian Healing, and a fully integrated behavioral health program. We have a long and successful history of training students and are proud of our graduates, who have gone on to work successfully in a variety of settings including community health, private practice, academia, military, correctional facilities, and schools. They practice locally in Hawaii, on the Continental US, and internationally (Canada and New Zealand). Many hold supervisory and/or leadership positions. Interns are welcomed into a team of 21 psychologists, 5 psychiatrists, 2 APRN-Rx, and medical and clinical assistants who are dedicated to their training and development. A unique strength of our program is that interns have year-long rotations which enables them to engage in long-term therapy, in-depth clinical supervision of cases, and see patients from intake through termination. Interns participate in a minimum of one rotation with traditional child psychotherapy emphasis and one with traditional adult psychotherapy emphasis. They also participate in the Primary Care and Biological Bases rotation, and engage in a minimum total of 6 months of psychological testing and report writing on the Assessment rotation, and participate in a Research and Program Development rotation (time on this rotation is varied). They may also request an additional rotation. The following rotations are currently available: Adult Outpatient and Child and Family Rotations: are located at our Waianae Main campus, which includes psychology and psychiatry. Interns will see patients with a wide range of presenting concerns, with emphasis on either the treatment of adults or children . Crisis Intervention and Outpatient Mental Health Rotation: is located in Adult Medicine, and interns collaborate with primary care providers and will see patients in the Emergency Department. They will gain experience in primary care psychology, crisis intervention, and triage for the appropriate levels of care. Pediatric Clinic rotation: is located in a pediatric setting and interns collaborate with pediatricians and pediatric case managers, and receive both behavioral health and pediatric health referrals. Women’s Health Clinic rotation : is located in a Women’s Health setting. Interns collaborate with OBGYN physicians and perinatal case managers, and see patients for concerns such as postpartum depression, adjustment to pregnancy/parenthood, domestic violence, and other behavioral health concerns. Ewa-West Oahu Community Health rotation : is located at Child and Family Services – Ewa, which provides opportunity for partnership/referral from various co-located social service agencies (e.g. CFS, and domestic violence and parenting agencies). Waipahu Behavioral Health Clinic rotation: is located in the Filipino Community Center and patients there are predominantly of Filipino ancestry, which provides opportunity for learning and experience with the population served. Nanakuli Clinic rotation : is located in an integrated primary care setting. Interns will train in collaboration with primary care and medical students. Kapolei Behavioral Health rotation : is located in West Oahu Community Health, across the hall from Specialty Clinic and above primary care, providing opportunities for collaboration. Primary Care and Biological Bases rotation: is an integrated primary care experience with psychopharmacology and biological bases training and exposure. School Based Behavioral Health: is located in Nanakuli and Waianae High and Intermediate Schools. This is not currently a rotation, but may be an opportunity in the future. Interns receive weekly didactics on various topics and participate in a 6-month biweekly seminar on psychopharmacology and the biological etiologies of mental illness. They provide supervision to practicum students and attend a biweekly supervision seminar, weekly journal club, and monthly grand rounds. Applicants with experience or interest in working with the Native Hawaiian population and/or medically underserved populations are encouraged to apply. A minimum 5 integrated written assessment reports is desired.

Interns have the opportunity to learn from a diverse and multidisciplinary team of professionals who practice a broad developmental and mentor-based training approach and use a combination of experiential, didactic, and practical training experiences to achieve training goals. As a result of this process, interns develop skills, competencies, and professional identities as psychologists. Training Philosophy The Wake Forest University Counseling Center Psychology Internship utilizes a practitioner-scholar model in which research informs practice. This approach integrates hands-on work in a multidisciplinary setting with scholarly reading, critical thinking, and self-reflection. We believe that providing both a supportive and challenging environment, as well as ongoing and reciprocal feedback from staff and peers creates the optimum space for interns to feel comfortable making and learning from mistakes and to experience personal and professional growth. We also believe it is important for interns to have the opportunity to tailor their training experience based on areas of interest, and to receive mentorship and guidance in developing a niche as a psychologist. Training opportunities will be developmentally appropriate for each individual’s level of training and experience, and will be sequential, cumulative and graded in complexity across the training year. The University Counseling Center (UCC) also utilizes a collaborative, systems approach to working with each other and within a larger campus environment. Therefore, we believe it is important for interns to learn how to navigate administrative processes, provide referrals to on and off-campus agencies, develop case management skills, collaborate with other departments on campus, coordinate crisis response, and manage multiple roles within the University, such as consulting with staff, students, and parents while maintaining confidentiality. The UCC is committed to providing multiculturally competent services and believes it is important for interns to be competent in working with clients, colleagues, and community members holding diverse intersecting identities. We foster this competence by providing training on identity and culture, encouraging interns to consult and collaborate with diverse and multidisciplinary staff members inside and outside of the UCC, and by challenging interns to reflect on their own intersecting identities, experiences of power, privilege, and oppression, and how shared and different identities affect their work with clients. Training Experiences Interns have the opportunity to work with a wide variety of clients in the University Counseling Center using multiple therapeutic modalities, including individual and group counseling, initial assessment and referral services, triage, and crisis intervention. Additionally, interns participate in non-clinical activities characteristic of working in a university counseling center, including supervision of a master’s-level counseling intern or psychology practicum student, case management in consultation with service providers in other offices on and off campus, consultation to any member of the campus community, and outreach activities and programming. Interns may also select special emphasis areas which include focused education, supervision, and provision of service in sport psychology, training and supervision, and trauma informed care. If you choose to apply to our site, you will have the option to apply to one or both of two programs/tracks: Generalist with Sport Psychology Emphasis : If you match to this program, you will be provided a generalist experience along with being assigned to the Sport Psychology Special Emphasis aspect of our program. Generalist with Trauma or Supervision Emphasis : If you match to this program, you will choose one of the following three options: • A generalist experience along with being assigned to the ""trauma informed care"" special emphasis area. • A generalist experience along with being assigned to the ""training and supervision"" special emphasis area. • A generalist experience only, which would not include any of the special emphasis areas.

We cannot make exceptions to the APA accreditation requirement. VERY IMPORTANT: There are two parts to the Navy internship applications: the APPIC AAPI and an application used to determine eligibility for commissioning as a naval officer. The Navy application is completed with the help of a Navy Medical Programs Officer Recruiter. Applicants are strongly encouraged to make contact with a recruiter as early as possible, preferably well before September 2025. Initiating contact with a recruiter after 1 October 2025 increases the risk that the application will not be completed by the Navy Recruiting Command deadline. (The Navy application includes a medical evaluation and there are frequently delays in getting those appointments scheduled). ** The deadline for submitting AAPI to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is 17 November 2025. The deadline for completing the Navy commissioning application is 1 December 2025. Applicants will be required to participate in virtual interviews at Walter Reed National Military Medication Center. This year, applicants will also be provided opportunities to participate in optional in-person visits to the internship site. These in-person visits will enable applicants to get a more complete picture of our internship training program, however visits are entirely optional and will not impact internship selection decisions. Virtual interviews will be conducted for the internship program at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center between 2-4 December 2025. Applicants who are selected for interviews will be contacted via email by the Walter Reed Program Director by 21 November 2025 to schedule an interview. Applicants who match with the program are commissioned as Navy Medical Service Corps Officers prior to starting internship and after internship completion are obligated to serve 3 years on active duty as Navy Psychologists. There is no military obligation for applicants who do not match, but all applicants must complete the recruiting process, including background checks and physical examination, in order to be considered for the internship. Please contact Navy Recruiting in your local area and ask to work specifically with a Navy Medical Programs Officer Recruiter. Finding a Recruiter : Unfortunately, there is no master list of Navy Medical Programs Officer Recruiters, so finding one can be challenging at times. There are two options for locating the Medical Programs Officer Recruiter nearest you: Go to the following website: U.S. Navy Clinical Psychology Careers | Navy.com , - Click on “Find a Recruiter” located at the bottom of the page, then type in your zip code. You can also call or use the chat feature to find a Medical Programs Officer Recruiter in your area. Not all recruiting stations have Medical Programs Officer Recruiters, but they should be able to easily direct you to the nearest one. Contact the Navy Clinical Psychology National Training Director (Dr. John Ralph), who can connect you with a recruiter in your local area. Dr. Ralph can be reached at John.a.ralph.civ@health.mil . The Navy Clinical Psychology Internship Program at Walter Reed has not established a minimum number of practicum hours, or required types of practicum settings, to be considered for our internships. However, given the predominantly adult focus of our internship, we specifically seek applicants with practicum experience in generalist clinical evaluation and psychotherapy work with adults. Experience with a wide range of psychological testing with adults (personality, projective, cognitive) is preferred. Experience with adults with major psychopathology is also preferred. Applicants with minimal experience with adults, or with adult experience only in narrowly focused specialty areas such as neuropsychological assessment, would be at a significant disadvantage in our review and APPIC ranking of applicants. For additional information, please contact Dr. Richard Bergthold (richard.d.bergthold.civ@health.mil), Director, Navy Clinical Psychology Internship Program, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Program Description U.S. NAVY CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY INTERNSHIP PROGRAM: The training model is that of Practitioner-Scholar, with two primary training aims: 1) to provide the trainee with experiences and skills needed to function competently as a broadly-trained clinical psychologist, and 2) to equip the intern with additional knowledge and skills needed to practice competently within the Navy. Training stresses exposure to multiple theoretical orientations and techniques. Rotations include Adult Outpatient (to include psychological testing to aid in diagnostic clarification and treatment planning), Health (to include Integrated Behavioral Health Consultation in Primary Care, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Women's Health, and Endocinology), and Inpatient (to include Psychiatric Consultation and Liaison Service). Adult outpatient rotation involves supervised diagnostic interviews, military specialty evaluations and short-term treatment (evidence-based treatments, cognitive-behavioral, short-term psychodynamic and other techniques). Health rotation focuses on learning a consultative model in a primary care setting (internal medicine clinic, women’s health clinic), involves brief evaluations of medical patients with recommendations and interventions aimed at symptom reduction and functional outcome. Health also includes rotations in the physical medicine and endocrinology services. The Inpatient rotation involves admission, diagnosis, stabilization, treatment and disposition of patients on two services: a psychiatric inpatient service and a neurobehavioral inpatient service. Rotation includes opportunities for multidisciplinary treatment and management of complex patients, with exposure to a wide range of severe pathology. One individual psychodynamic case is carried throughout the year with weekly supervision. Supervised trauma cases are assigned while on the outpatient rotation using evidence-based treatments appropriate to the patient presentation. Didactic seminars are presented throughout the year and range from 2 hours to two-day workshops. Previous Seminar topics include: MMPI-2, MCMI III, PAI, Psychodynamic Theory and Practice, Assessment and Treatment of Suicidal Patients, Ethics, Operational Psychology, Cultural Competence, Assessment and Selection of Special Military Populations and Military Sexual Trauma, to name a few. The Navy Clinical Psychology Internship Program is located at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland on the former site of the National Naval Medical Center. The program received 10-year re-accreditation by APA in 2018.

Interns in the 2026-2027 cohort will start their internship at the current location of Walter P. Reuther Psychiatric Hospital (30901 Palmer Road, Westland, MI 48186) and will complete the duration of their internship in Northville, MI in the new hospital once it opens. Construction and hospital transition updates will be presented during the Internship Open House and provided over the course of summer 2026 to matched Interns. While the name and location of the hospital will change, there are no planned changes to the services provided or populations treated by the new hospital. As such, there are no expected significant changes to the Internship.

First, intern applicants who match for the doctoral internship at CAPS will be subject to a pre-employment criminal background check within the state of Washington and nationwide. A “clear” criminal background check requires that the intern has no record of criminal history that would prohibit them from providing psychological counseling according to the laws of the State of Washington (see RCWs 43.43.830 – 43.43.842). Second, per RCW 28B.112 – Postsecondary Educational Institutions – Sexual Misconduct, applicants for positions at WSU are required to sign a statement, prior to an official offer of employment: a) declaring whether the applicant is the subject of any substantiated findings of sexual misconduct in any current or former employment or is currently being investigated for, or has left a position during an investigation into, a violation of any sexual misconduct policy at the applicant’s current and past employers, and, if so, an explanation of the situation; b) authorizing the applicant’s current and past employers to disclose to WSU any sexual misconduct committed by the applicant and making available to the hiring institution copies of all documents in the previous employer’s personnel, investigative, or other files relating to sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment, by the applicant. The criminal background check, as well as completion of the Sexual Misconduct Statement and related check with former employers will occur following the APPIC Match. Official offer letters to interns will be sent following clear criminal background and sexual misconduct checks. Program Description The Washington State University (WSU) Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) doctoral internship program is accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA) Commission on Accreditation (CoA). Questions related to the program's accreditation status should be directed to the CoA: www.apa.org/ed/accreditation; apaaccred@apa.org; 202-336-5979. WSU is a land grant university with ~17,000 students attending its Pullman campus, where the program is located. Approximately 35% of students identify as first-generation college students, 30% identify as multicultural, and 7% identify as international. WSU is among the top universities nationally for policies supportive of LGBTQ students (5/5 Stars according to Campus Pride Index, 2024). The CAPS doctoral psychology internship program is housed within Student Affairs and is an integral part of Cougar Health Services (CHS): CAPS, medical clinic, pharmacy, and vision clinic. The WSU CAPS internship training takes a developmental approach and focuses on the transition from practicum-level performance to advanced level knowledge, awareness, skills and interventions. The program's aim is to provide the professional training and experience necessary for independent entry-level practice as a health service psychologist in a wide variety of settings, including university counseling centers. CAPS trains interns such that their work is informed by practice, theory, and research and takes into account individual, cultural, and societal considerations. Each training year begins with extensive orientation. Over the year, CAPS provides didactic and experiential training to facilitate growth across the profession-wide competencies established by APA (research, ethical and legal standards, diversity, professional values and attitudes, communication and interpersonal skills, assessment, intervention, supervision, and consultation and interprofessional/interdisciplinary skills). CAPS offers weekly training seminars and multiple supervision experiences through which interns can address specific training needs and interests. Supervision includes individual supervision, group supervision, supervision of supervision, assessment supervision, diversity liaison supervision, and minor rotation supervision. Interns provide these direct services: initial consultations, individual therapy, groups and workshops, LD/ADHD assessments, motivational interviewing-based AOD interventions, crisis management, outreach, the provision of supervision, and optional biofeedback. Interns do not have after-hours on-call responsibilities. Currently, all staff and interns work primarily from their campus offices and CAPS offers a hybrid of in-person and telehealth services. The internship provides as much supervision and training in-person as is feasible and effective. Each intern's training is tailored through participation in diversity liaisons and minor rotations. As liaisons, interns are paired with senior clinicians to collaborate with a university office/organization serving diverse student groups. Examples include Multicultural Student Services, the LGBTQ+ Center, International Programs, and the ROAR program (serving students with moderate intellectual disabilities). Semester-long minor rotations are clinical or teaching-based. Training and experiences in minor rotations exceed that which all interns receive. Options include but are not limited to: biofeedback, doctoral practicum class co-instruction, groups, LD/ADHD assessment, trauma treatment, outreach, or another rotation agreed upon with the Training Director. Interns are involved in CAPS diversity training, contributing to two clinician diversity trainings each semester. They may also participate on the CAPS diversity committee, which meets 2 times/month and guides the planning and implementation of CAPS diversity efforts. Interns engage in research through seminar and outreach preparation as well as their dissertation progress or a small research project for CAPS. They gain administrative experience through participation in the intern selection process, attendance at CAPS and CHS meetings, organization of diversity trainings, and optional committee work. CAPS' clinicians highly value training and enjoy opportunities to supervise and mentor interns. The program supports increased independence over the year by systematically introducing more complex responsibilities while adjusting supervisory oversight to enhance interns' professional autonomy. By the end of the training year, it is expected that interns will be ready for entry-level doctorate employment or postdoctoral training in a variety of health service psychology settings.

For information on the vaccination requirements please see: https://occupationalhealth.wustl.edu/new-employees/school-of-medicine-employees/ Program Description The Center for Counseling and Psychological Services (CCPS) at Washington University in St. Louis (Wash U) offers a full-time comprehensive twelve-month Doctoral Internship in Health Service Psychology for students working toward their doctoral degrees in counseling or clinical psychology. We emphasize the core elements of counseling center work in our program; however the skill set developed is highly transferable to other clinical settings in professional psychology. Four interns are admitted to the internship program per academic year, and CCPS offers a highly competitive stipend and compensation package. The internship for the 2026-2027 academic will begin on Wednesday, July 15, 2026 and runs for one full calendar year and is a 2000 hour (500 direct service) internship. Internship begins with an initial orientation period during which time the interns are introduced to the training schedule and evaluation process and the CCPS staff and Wash U Student Affairs community. Orientation is also a time for interns to begin developing specific training interests and goals as well as identifying supervisors and concentration areas. There are core competencies of the internship program represented by the two primary aims of 1) Interns developing the skills and competencies needed to successfully function as an entry-level health service psychologist capable of working with a diverse clientele in a university counseling center or other related clinical environment and 2) Interns developing a solid professional identity as a health service psychologist. Additionally, our internship offers three potential concentration areas of 1) Group Therapy, 2) Treatment of Eating Disorders and 3) Sport Psychology. To that end, we strive to provide a training experience that is both consistent in the core components but also individualized to meet the differing needs, interests and goals of each intern. Our internship received provisional membership to the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) in 2024 and our APPIC number is 2613. Internship is a time to continue the development of professional competencies and to make the transition from graduate student to professional. The CCPS internship program aspires to further the growth and development of psychologists in training focusing by expanding their generalist skills and their focus on university counseling center work. Within this context, the training program most closely identifies with the practitioner-scholar model of psychological training. . We seek to integrate the professional and personal development of our interns as they proceed through out program. We believe that part of the development process requires moments of vulnerability, stretching out of one’s comfort zone, and trying new things. We attempt to create an environment that provides the appropriate balance of support as interns have experiences that may be new and challenging. Additionally, we hope to foster an environment that allows our interns to build strong relationships with each other through curiosity, collaboration and a focus on cultural humility. We seek to assist our interns in becoming confident and competent new professionals who have a passion for their work. While there is a basic “core” component of the internship program, interns are encouraged and able to individualize and customize their training experience at CCPS in terms of client population and issues, areas of concentration, outreach, and group. As interns traverse through the course of the internship year, they will have the opportunity to engage in professional experiences that increase in complexity and difficulty and will take on more responsibility. The hope is that having an increase in responsibility and complexity will continue to foster their development and their confidence as they prepare to complete their training experience.

Program Description The aim of our internship program is to create competent and ethical entry-level psychologists who value interdisciplinary collaboration, and demonstrate the skills needed to evaluate empirical knowledge and consider individual differences and diverse identities in their clinical practice. WSU Counseling and Psychological Services is rooted in the Practitioner-Scholar Model of training and is committed to the training and development of Psychology Interns. This program is designed to prepare psychology doctoral interns across the nine profession wide competencies defined by APA Standards of Accreditation (SoA). Each competency will be achieved by participation in a range of training activities and supervised direct service delivery activities. At CAPS we offer an immersive and developmentally-tailored training experience. We strive to structure training experiences with developmentally appropriate challenges that are based in trainees’ past experience and areas of interest. During their training at CAPS, trainees immerse themselves in all aspects of work at WSU CAPS including clinical services, consultation, outreach to the University community, and professional development. Trainees’ clinical efforts are supported with intensive and diverse supervision experiences. We aim to foster professional growth in a supportive and inclusive environment. We value and consider all points of view and strive to collaborate within our own staff and across the University. Our training program is rooted in creating multiculturally competent and ethical professionals that proudly advocate for WSU’s diverse student body. We emphasize evidence-based practice and teach our trainees to evaluate empirical knowledge and consider individual differences and diverse identities in their clinical practice. Interdisciplinary collaboration is embedded within both our training program and broader clinic. Trainees are given the opportunity to work with and learn from staff from all mental health professions (counseling, social work, psychology, and psychiatry). It is our belief that such interdisciplinary collaboration strengthens trainees’ command of the broader mental health field and their clinical expertise. Our trainees are integral and valued members of our staff. It is our hope that training at CAPS is a transformative experience that assists trainees in developing not only their professional competencies, but also their professional identities.

This must be completed prior to start of the internship. Program Description The aim of the internship program is to train the next generation of psychologists in evidence-based, ethical, and culturally responsive clinical care through a rigorous scientist-practitioner training model, integrating empirical research with clinical expertise to deliver high-quality psychological services. Our program is dedicated to providing a comprehensive and supportive training environment that fosters the development of advanced clinical skills, critical thinking, and professional identity through a balance of hands-on clinical experience, supervision, interdisciplinary collaboration, and scholarly inquiry. We will prepare interns to be adaptive, reflective, and scientifically minded professionals equipped to contribute meaningfully to diverse communities and to the evolving field of psychology. The program curriculum is designed to be sequential, cumulative and graded in complexity to align with the developmental needs of interns as they progress toward readiness for entry-level practice. Interns begin the year with orientation activities focused on foundational competencies including ethics, informed consent, documentation, clinical procedures and risk management. Early training will emphasize base assessment and intervention skills with intensive supervision and structured didactics in generalist practice areas. As the year progresses, interns will engage in increasingly complex activities such as co-facilitating therapy groups, conducting substance use evaluations, participating in multidisciplinary case consultations and working with higher acuity or more diagnostically complex patients. Didactics mirror this progression as basic intervention skills move toward advanced therapy interventions and specialized treatment (e.g., substance use disorders, trauma-informed care). The Professional Development and Practice Series didactic will move from confidentiality and privacy, informed consent, and professional boundaries to professional identity, applying for post-doctoral fellowships and life-long learning to stay current in the field. All interns will engage in experiential training that will include providing services delivered directly to service recipients. Interns will undergo either direct or recorded observation of their cases during their internship. Most of these hours will occur earlier in the internship year to ensure interns receive feedback about strengths and areas for growth. Observation later in the year will be used to provide interns feedback on ways in which their skills have evolved over the course of the internship. Interns will receive at least 3 hours of individual and 1 hour of group supervision each week led by a licensed psychologist. Supervision will include discussions about ongoing cases, as well as ethics, science and professional development. Individual supervision will include a review of client status and progress, progress notes and other documentation, and assessments (e.g., case conceptualization, measure selection, and data interpretation). Interns and supervisors will discuss therapeutic orientation and techniques, professional ethics and growth, and peer supervision. Group supervision will touch on similar topics. Interns will also present cases for discussion with the lead supervisor and fellow interns. The internship program is housed within a dynamic medical school environment that fits naturally with the aim of the program. The outpatient and substance use disorder clinics will provide a rich context for the program’s aim . Interns will engage in supervised clinical work with diverse patient populations presenting with a wide range of psychological and substance use disorders, which will allow them to apply empirically supported interventions in real-world settings. The interdisciplinary nature of the medical school promotes collaboration with professionals from psychiatry, primary care, social work, and nursing which will model and reinforce the practice of integrated care. Exposure to ongoing clinical research and a culture of scientific inquiry will support the program’s commitment to the scientist-practitioner model and encourage interns to critically evaluate and integrate current research into their clinical practice. Through this immersive experience, interns will be prepared to deliver high-quality psychological services in complex, multidisciplinary environments . The core competencies of the internship program are as follows.

Also, we seek interns who are capable of a close reading of the relevant research literature and of presenting this clearly and succinctly to a professional audience in the true tradition of the practitioner-scholar. WellSpan Philhaven offers a full spectrum of psychological services to virtually all diagnostic categories and all ages in inpatient, crisis intervention, intensive outpatient, outpatient, and medical-surgical settings. The internship has a strong cognitive behavioral orientation aimed to address the physical and emotional health of the population.

Program Description The WellSpan Philhaven Hospital Doctoral Internship in Health Service Psychology Program is known for its strong clinical training within a multidisciplinary, hospital-based setting that is part of a large health system, WellSpan Health. The internship program includes exposure to diverse clientele including children, adolescents, and adults from urban, suburban, and rural areas, representing many ethnic groups and socio-economic classes. The program offers a variety of clinical experiences for interns in multiple levels of care, such as inpatient, day hospital and outpatient services. Interns are also exposed to services emphasizing spiritual integration, including services for our clients from Plain Communities (Amish, Mennonite, etc.). These services represent Philhaven’s rich and long history of providing spiritually integrated services to local populations. The program is structured as a 12-month, full-time training experience. Interns can expect to gain experience and develop skills in individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, couples/family therapy, diagnostic evaluations, psychological testing, consultation, supervision and other professional roles and activities. The program offers 4 intern positions across two clinical tracks, with 3 General Track interns and 1 Child and Adolescent Specialty Track intern. Interns in the General Track have two rotations in Adult Services and one rotation in Child and Adolescent Services. Each rotation is approximately four months long. One Adult rotation relates to the Adult Inpatient Programs and is focused on assessment and consultation. The assessment component typically includes general diagnostic assessment, including some neuropsychological screening experience. The other Adult rotation is based in Day Hospital (Partial) and Intensive Outpatient Programs and emphasizes various modalities of treatment with a major focus on group therapy. The Child and Adolescent rotation is based in the Child and Adolescent Inpatient Program, including various treatment activities such as individual therapy, family therapy, group therapy, and psychological assessment. On the rotations, the mix of assignments may vary according to the intern’s professional interests and skills, needs of the various programs and the goals of the internship. The Child and Adolescent Specialty Track is designed for the intern who is interested in a career in child and adolescent psychology. Interns in the Specialty Track provide services in inpatient and outpatient programs. The Child/Adolescent Track intern provides individual therapy, family therapy, group therapy, psychological assessment, consultation, etc. The intern primarily operates within the Child and Adolescent Services throughout the internship year, but has exposure to serving adult populations as well. Specific assignments are made with consideration of the intern’s professional interests and the needs of the clinical programs. All interns carry outpatient psychotherapy cases throughout the year. Two days per week are allotted for outpatient assignments. We are planning to utilize several WellSpan Philhaven outpatient clinics and programs for intern training, including our behavioral health offices serving our local cities and towns, and our Plain Communities Outpatient Clinic on our Mt. Gretna campus. Completion of internship requirements includes one evening of work per week, while most of the intern’s work is scheduled during daytime business hours. Interns receive a minimum of two hours per week of one-to-one supervision. Supervision will be provided by two psychologists whose competencies match the programs to which interns are assigned. Interns also receive two hours of group supervision per week. We currently provide individual and group supervision in both in-person and telesupervision formats, consistent with our program’s telesupervision policies and APA telesupervision guidelines. Didactic seminars are designed for interns, involving lectures, discussions and readings on professional topics and training issues, and occur an average of 1 hour per week. Seminar topics relate to the profession-wide competencies identified in the SoA for Health Service Psychologists. We plan to provide both in-person and remote synchronous (live, audio and video) trainings for interns. The WellSpan Philhaven Hospital Doctoral Psychology Internship program was fully accredited by the American Psychological Association effective July 14, 1989. The program has maintained APA accreditation status continuously since that time. Please see program handbook for additional information.

COVID-19 vaccination is required. Program Description The Psychology Section is part of the Mental Health & Behavioral Science Service (MH&BS). The Psychology Section at the West Palm Beach VAMC consists of approximately 30+ full-time psychologists. Psychologists provide care in traditional mental health programs, including general Mental Health, Clinical Health, PTSD, and Substance Abuse clinics and are integrated into various other settings, including Primary Care, Blind Rehabilitation, Recovery and Rehabilitation Programs and Community Living Center. MH&BS leadership includes the Chief of the MH&BS, Assistant Chief of MH&BS, Chief of Psychiatry, Chief of Psychology, Assistant Chief of Psychology and Director of Training. The WPB Internship Program has been funded since the 2011-2012 training year. We had our initial APA accreditation site in 2013 and a recent site visit occurred in November 2023. The next site visit is scheduled to be held in 2033. The Program follows a practitioner-scholar model. Our primary goal is to expose predoctoral interns to a diversity of patient problems and many different intervention techniques as guided by relevant scientific literature. Based upon this philosophy, interns receive broad, comprehensive training in preparation for entry-level, generalist practice in health service psychology with an emphasis on evidenced-based psychotherapies. Although we believe that training in clinical and counseling psychology at the predoctoral level should be broadly based, the internship retains sufficient flexibility to allow for specialized training needs and interests of the intern to be met. Below is a list of the five major rotations that are currently available for psychology interns at the WPB VA. 1. Mental Health Outpatient Clinic 2. Community Living Center/Geropsychology 3. Trauma Recovery Program 4. Primary Care Mental Health Integration 5. Substance Abuse Treatment Program In addition, seven minor rotations are available in Mental Health Clinic, Interprofessional team experience, Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery program (PRRC), Pain Management, Suicide Prevention (SPC), Evidence-Based Psychotherapy, and Neuropsychology.

Our Clinical Psychology Internship Program, emphasizes broad and general training in health service psychology with areas of emphasis in clinical health psychology, child/pediatric psychology, and neuropsychology within an academic medical center. Our goal is to prepare interns to be successful in the evolving field of psychology/healthcare for careers in a variety of settings, including medical or academic medical centers, university psychology departments, and clinical settings that offer inpatient and/or psychological outpatient services. Our program is based on the scientist-practitioner model of training, emphasizing evidence-based primarily cognitive-behavioral approaches to assessment and intervention. Our faculty are dedicated to training and we follow a junior-colleague model of supervision. To achieve these goals, we emphasize a comprehensive approach to training across clinical work, didactics, and research. Our program offers a breath of experiences with opportunities for clinical rotations in a number of settings including outpatient behavioral health, medical specialty and subspecialty clinics, primary care, and VA settings. Interns gain clinical experience with patients across the lifespan representing a broad range of presenting problems in both inpatient and outpatient treatment settings. Our clinical rotations allow interns to hone generalist skills, but also offer specialization in behavioral medicine, pediatric/child clinical psychology, and neuropsychology areas including presurgical evaluations, bariatric and eating concerns, pediatric subspecialties, neurodevelopment, integrated care, and specialty neuropsychological populations. Our didactics focus on preparing the intern to meet the varying roles and challenges of professional life including, clinical service within medical settings, teaching/supervision, scholarship, consultation, and program evaluation/ development. Finally, research skill development is considered an important training goal and as such, interns are allotted protected research time to complete a mentored research project. We are committed to developing an individualized and tailored training experience for the intern. We have three interns annually: one in clinical health psychology (APPIC#163913), one in child/pediatric psychology (APPIC# 163911), and one in neuropsychology (APPIC# 163914).

Program Description Each intern is assigned to one of two WJCS’ mental health clinics in Yonkers and Hartsdale. This placement, which lasts for the entire year, is considered the intern’s primary placement. For one to three days each week, the intern conducts individual, family and group therapy, psychological assessments, staff training and consultation to members of a multi-disciplinary treatment team. Some interns receive case assignments from specialized programs (e.g., trauma and developmental disabilities) at their primary placement. All interns co-lead at least one DBT group. The intern spends one day participating in supervision and didactics. Psychological testing experience is provided in conducting psychoeducational and other evaluations, in addition to forensic assessment. One half-day per week is formally set aside to perform research to support WJCS clinical activities. In addition, qualified interns are expected to provide supervision to psychology externs and other graduate students. WJCS is a vibrant agency, hosting an exciting array of programs (many cutting edge) that meet diverse community needs. (Consult the WJCS website, www.wjcs.com , for a current listing). The agency will make an effort to give an intern exposure to programs of special interest that meet his or her individual training needs, when other internship requirements have been met.

Program Description WestCoast Children’s Clinic offers a full-time doctoral internship in clinical psychology. We are committed to training the next generation of mental health professionals who care about working with clients in the communities and systems in which they live, expanding consciousness with regard to diversity and social justice, and advocating at various scales within systems as needed. The agency is located in the Fruitvale district of Oakland, California and serves a rich diversity of children and families throughout Alameda and San Francisco counties. Most of our clients have experienced complex trauma and challenges associated with inequitable opportunity to resources, while many are also involved in foster care and the child welfare system. Interns participate in the Outpatient Therapy and Therapeutic Assessment Programs, working collaboratively with the families of young children, school-aged children and adolescents. Services can be provided in the clinic but also take place in homes, schools, parks, and other neighborhood locations most convenient to families. While our work is grounded in psychodynamic and systems perspectives, we are committed to developing innovative ways of conducting assessments, therapy and advocacy that are conscious of and relevant to the communities we serve. Trauma theory and research in the context of cultural diversity significantly influences our work. Services are also provided in Spanish, with corresponding clinical supervision in Spanish for bilingual therapists. Culturally responsive practice, social justice, and the links between practice and policy are emphasized throughout the agency and intern training program.

Accordingly, interns are not eligible for the employer subsidized North Carolina State Health Plan. However, interns may elect to either keep existing healthcare coverage they may already have or independently purchase healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Interns may elect within 30 days of internship start date to enroll in the North Carolina State High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP); it should be noted that there is no employer contribution to HDHP coverage. An overview of this plan is available here: https://www.shpnc.org/employee-benefits/high-deductible-health-plan-active-employees If you elected this option, your coverage would start on September 1. Interns can also compare coverage and costs with the general ACA Marketplace plans available through https://www.healthcare.gov/ Please consult with Human Resources regarding any other current fringe benefits available to temporary hourly employees. More information is also available at http://hr.wcu.edu . Please refer to CAPS website and doc intern brochure for other benefit info: https://www.wcu.edu/experience/health-and-wellness/caps/capstraining.aspx This position is not vacation or sick leave earning. However, in order to obtain the necessary hours to complete internship, we have calculated twenty-four (24) days of time away from work that may be used (with prior supervisor approval) over the course of the internship year. The 24 days of time away from work are also inclusive of university holidays when the CAPS office is closed. Because interns are paid at an hourly rate, their biweekly paycheck may vary depending upon if the intern uses any time away from work or if there are holidays during that pay period. When the 24 days away from work are used over the course of the internship year, the remaining days spent working at the calculated hourly rate described above will equate to being paid the advertised stipend of $31,000 per year. The internship year officially ends as of July 31. Employee expressly understands that these days of time away from work carry no cash value and will not be paid out to the employee if not utilized before the end of the appointment period as defined above. Other fringe benefits: Personal offices with desktop PC & webcam; library access with inter-library loan privileges; university holidays off; CAT Card Employee Discounts; parking near office building (with purchase of staff parking permit); faculty/staff membership rate at Campus Recreation Center (73,000 sq ft facility with indoor track, cardio equipment, free weights, basketball court, group exercise classes, rock climbing & bouldering wall, Adventure Shop for outdoor equipment rental, access to campus pool, etc.); other state employee optional discounts; access to athletic events; ongoing theater and cultural events through Bardo Fine and Performing Arts Center. Brief description of the typical work day for an intern at this training site The CAPS office is open from Mondays - Fridays from 8 AM - 5 PM. Interns are expected to work 40 hours per week (which includes a daily 1 hr lunch break). Approximately 20 hours a week are spent in face-to-face psychological services to clients (consisting of Quick Access triage appointments, therapeutic intakes, personal counseling, group counseling, crisis services, outreach and consultation, and 3rd party consultations). At least 2 hours a week are spent in didactic activities (including seminars, professional development/in-services, and case conferences). Interns receive a minimum of 4 hours a week of supervision (2 hours with a primary supervisor who is a licensed psychologist; 1 hour a week of cohort supervision; 1 hour of additional supervision which could include group work, secondary supervision, supervision of supervision, or additional cohort supervision). The actual number of hours spent in each activity may vary from week to week. This position is on-site at our Cullowhee campus; the majority of our clients prefer in-person services (over 80% of sessions were provided in-person in 2023-2024) so the intern must be able to deliver services on-site. In the spring semester, interns receive training in the provision of supervision. Depending on the needs of the interns and our master's/practicum trainees, the sup of sup experience may include options for role play, periodic consultation with master's trainees, co-facilitation and supervision of a master's trainee's group work, or potentially supervising a small number of individual cases with a master's trainee.

In considering places to live in the area, we encourage staff and interns to have access to reliable transportation and to be mindful of commute times for their own personal needs, to consider the impact on distance on being able to engage with work related activities, to consider the cost of gas in your commute, and to consider your own work/life blending. Our work hours are M – F, 8 AM – 5 PM, and we regularly have meetings and/or client obligations that start at 8 AM and are scheduled till 5 PM. Staff in the past have typically lived in places including Cullowhee, Sylva, Dillsboro, Bryson City, Franklin, Waynesville, and Clyde. Please also know that since we are in a rural area, public transportation and pedestrian-friendly options to get to campus are very limited. Also, driving 30 minutes here in the mountains means you are probably driving 30 miles! We strongly recommend that applicants who successfully match to the WCU CAPS internship program allow sufficient time to move and get settled in the area prior to the first day of internship as this can at times be a challenge living in a rural community where local businesses can have limited hours. The beginning of the internship year includes an intensive orientation schedule from 8 AM – 5 PM each weekday that may not allow sufficient time for outside errands or other time outside the office. Interns are also required to maintain their own professional (student) liability insurance during their internship and will provide proof of insurance coverage to the Training Director by the start of internship. After applicants successfully match to our site, they must also complete a standard human resources job application as part of being a WCU staff member which includes a background check and screening for eligibility requirements. This is a standard procedure for all WCU employees as doctoral interns are classified as WCU staff.

If you are currently receiving services at WCU CAPS and intend to apply to the training program, you should discuss this with your counselor to avoid potential conflict of interest. For applicants who are accepted into the training program, they cannot receive WCU CAPS counseling services once they begin their training experience at CAPS. CAPS can provide community referral information in these situations. You can talk to your counselor more about these options. This position is on-site at our Cullowhee campus; the majority of our clients prefer in-person services (over 80% of sessions were provided in-person in 2023-2024) so the intern must be able to deliver services on-site. While not a requirement in NC, we recognize that other states may have licensure requirements regarding the number of years the supervisor has been licensed. Your primary clinical supervisor will be a doctoral level licensed psychologist, but due to changes in staffing, we cannot guarantee your supervisor will meet the requirements of other states in terms of numbers of years of licensure.

The meeting is used as a time to plan as a team how to meet the established treatment plan goals/objectives. Interns will be acclimated to the unit, shadow their supervisor for a period of time and will be observed providing clinical and assessment services before functioning more autonomously. Interns conduct individual therapy with assigned patients, conduct group therapy at least once per week, and conduct family therapy sessions as determined by treatment plan. Under the supervision of a licensed psychologist, interns are responsible for all aspects of assigned patient's care from admission to discharge. This includes safety planning, lethality assessment, providing evidenced based treatment, case management and discharge planning. Interns are also involved in the milieu, modeling safe and prosocial behavior. The Psychology Doctoral Internship Training Program at Western New York Children’s Psychiatric Center (WNYCPC) experience was created to provide interns with a comprehensive, productive, and diverse experience with children and adolescents across a broad range of psychopathology, child/adolescent development, gender and cultural diversity. This extensive experience provides interns a solid foundation in which they may hone their skills and determine possible areas of specialization. The WNYCPC Internship begins the last Thursday in August and continues for a full calendar year. Interns generally work 40 hours a week with one late evening to accommodate families. Interns complete a 6 month rotation on the inpatient setting and a 6 month rotation at the Day Treatment Program at the Community Services site. After a comprehensive new employee orientation and orientation with the Director of Psychology Internship Training, interns will begin work with a treatment team on an inpatient unit or the Day Treatment Program. Each intern works in conjunction with a treatment team psychologist and functions as a member of the treatment team. Under close supervision, interns will learn documentation requirements within a Joint Commission accredited hospital setting. Interns will initially shadow their supervisors and will be observed in clinical tasks. Interns will work alongside their supervisor on up to four assigned individual primary therapist cases. This will include provision of individual and family therapy. Over the course of the rotation interns will increasingly gain more autonomy with the clinical cases (i.e. individual/family sessions). As part of their responsibilities, interns communicate directly with families and provide family consultation and therapy where clinically appropriate. The team psychologists are directly responsible for the supervision of the intern’s functioning within the team and meet with the intern for a minimum of two hours per week for supervision (i.e., reviewing all documentation as well as supervising all psychotherapy cases and group work). Interns also meet once weekly with the Director of Psychology Internship Training for group supervision (2 hours). Therapeutic modalities include DBT, CBT, family systems and psychoeducational support for parents. Psychological assessment, report writing, and diagnostic presentations are an essential component of the WNYCPC Internship. Interns may be assigned Psychological Evaluations across all WNYCPC units/programs, ensuring that they will have experience with a variety of patients and interact across all multidisciplinary teams for psychodiagnostic testing feedback sessions. A cognitive assessment (review of records, brief IQ test, recommendations) is completed for every admitted patient. In addition, psychodiagnostic assessments are completed upon request from the unit psychiatrist. Interns will initially shadow their supervisors and will be observed while completing test administration, scoring and interpretation. Interns may complete assessments on their assigned unit and will have the opportunity to complete these assessments on the other units/programs. Interns may present findings to the respective treatment teams, family, and patient as therapeutically indicated. Interns could complete, at minimum, 20 psychological assessments (cognitive/psychodiagnostics) per year. All interns attend a weekly didactic seminars, which cover an array of topics relevant to developing independent psychologists. Does this site have practicum psychology students on site?

The WNYCPC mission is to provide effective treatments which support hope and recovery for children and adolescents with significant psychiatric and behavioral challenges. The facility’s mission underscores its commitments to the highest standard of patient care and excellence in clinical training. WNYCPC strives to honor our values and principles by providing: youth guided and family driven treatment, data driven quality improvement, healing supported by culture, traditions and beliefs, and a therapeutic environment that is non-coercive, trauma sensitive and violence free. The Psychology Discipline of WNYCPC is committed to providing the highest professional standards in the performance of all services provided. The aim of our internship training is to provide interns with comprehensive clinical training in the delivery of empirically based, culturally competent, individualized clinical services to children, adolescents, families, and communities. The Western New York Children’s Psychiatric Center Psychology Doctoral Internship Training Program aligns with the mission of WNY CPC to deliver the best clinical practices within a safe and therapeutic setting. WNYCPC is committed to working with children and adolescents with severe and persistent mental illness by providing comprehensive care; this encompasses the emotional, social and academic needs of each child/adolescent at the hospital and in the community setting. WNYCPC works closely with the individual child/adolescent, their families and their school districts to best meet each individual’s needs and to help them to sustain their gains when returning to the community as they step down from the intensive therapeutic setting of the hospital. Our interns function within all of these systems including working both inpatient and outpatient, with families, school districts and community agencies. The WNYCPC Doctoral Internship Training Program goals include enhancing professional development under supervision of a Licensed Psychologist and to provide a means for each intern to develop and mature in their professional identity as a clinician and as a member of a clinical team. By the end of the internship year, interns are capable of providing the full range of services needed to work as clinical psychologists treating children and adolescents with complex, multilayered difficulties across both inpatient and outpatient populations.

Vaccinations can be obtained for free at UPMC vaccination clinics or at a variety of off-site locations including pharmacies. Program Description Western Psychiatric Hospital (WPH) and the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine offer an APA-accredited, rotating internship in clinical psychology. We adhere to a 'clinical science' model of training and professional development in which the primary principles are a commitment to empiricism for guiding both clinical and scientific work, and an emphasis on the reciprocal relationship between clinical practice and the development and investigation of important questions for clinical research. We have four general goals for the program: (1) Develop and consolidate clinical skills in psychiatric assessment, conceptualization, and evidence-based psychological interventions; (2) Provide broad clinical experience within multidisciplinary treatment and research teams located within a university-based medical center; (3) Consolidate and enhance skills in clinical psychological science and supplement the clinical experience with adequate time and resources for empirical exploration of a specialty area; and (4) Provide training in cultural humility and cultural competence in both clinical work and research domains. Our program provides two options: (a) a one-year general internship emphasizing clinical experience with major disorders in children and adults; and (b) a multiyear clinical research track that begins with the predoctoral internship and includes additional years of postdoctoral training to provide participants with the skills necessary to conduct clinical research. Applicants to the program initially commit to one year of training. Decisions about postdoctoral training are made in the spring of the internship year (and are subject to availability of postdoctoral training slots). Strengths of the program include assessment and diagnosis of psychopathology (both Axis I and Axis II disorders) in adults and children, psychosocial treatments of major disorders (with an emphasis on evaluation and outcome research), behavioral medicine, the application of new quantitative tools to clinical research problems, and a firm programmatic commitment to cultural humility.

Brief description of the typical work day for an intern at this training site A typical work day at Western State Hospital would include completing intake assessments on patients newly admitted to the hospital, participating in individual or group supervision, attending didactics as offered, conducting individual therapy for patients staying past 72 hours, conducting testing as needed and appropriate, and working on ""background projects"" such as blog articles and individual case studies. While the internship is majority on-site, since the COVID-19 pandemic we have continued a hybrid model of care, where interns will at times be in person and at times be virtual, depending on the health status of patients being served, and of interns, as well as the general risk level of the hospital and local area with respect to various pandemic/endemic contagious diseases.

No supplemental materials required. Interviews will be virtual and focused on a matrix of skills, but it also behavioral in nature, allowing interns to discuss how they have approached training and clinical issues in the past, with 3-5 interviewers who actively supervise and educate interns in the program. Virtual tours of the training site will be provided on our website, and prospective interns will have unsupervised access to current interns by email, telephone, and virtual meetings if desired. Interviews typically take place at staggered times on the scheduled day, with prospective interns having some input into the times that work best for them. Each interview slot is around 60 minutes in duration. At this time, we plan to use Zoom as a primary platform. Time will be provided for question/answer, and current interns will be available virtually for private virtual meetings as well. Please note: W e recognize that students may have had difficulty compiling practicum hours, depending on local practices and pandemic conditions during 2020-2022., and subsequent changes in facility staffings, policies, and practices.

Program Description White Birch Educational Services, LLC (WBES) was established in 2017 to support school districts in meeting their needs for school psychology services. WBES is a woman-owned and operated organization, led by a school psychologist, that has expanded to provide educational consultation and staffing solutions for various services, training, and clinical support throughout New Hampshire. Supervision, training, and administrative tasks occur at the main office in Exeter, New Hampshire. The WBES team has diverse clinical backgrounds, including psychologists, school psychologists, clinical specialists, and special education professionals. We have trained Master’s and Doctoral-level school psychology and mental health counseling students, including interns and postdoctoral psychologists. The extensive knowledge and experience of the White Birch team are reflected in the company’s core focus of empowering children and supporting communities. The program represents a collaborative effort between WBES and New Hampshire school districts to provide a range of clinical and didactic training experiences. With its mission to train and prepare interns for independent practice and to meet state requirements for licensure or certification as a psychologist and health service provider, the program’s training goals are intended to support and develop the next generation of leaders in the profession. Interns are placed in a New Hampshire school district, where they work closely with a multidisciplinary special education team, including a licensed school psychologist and special education-related service providers such as school-based mental health counselors, speech pathologists, and occupational therapists. School site placement is based on their previous experience and their specific goals for the internship year. Secondary schools or a rotation can be assigned as necessary to round out their on-site experience. Each placement provides supervised, introductory experiences in multiple roles that a psychologist can hold when practicing in a school setting. Interns are expected to provide services such as assessment, individual and group counseling, consultation with parents, teachers, and staff, crisis intervention, and behavioral interventions for general and special education students. The intern will be required to participate in Special Education meetings for students whom they have evaluated and serve. Interns also participate in intervention teams (e.g., Response to Intervention, Multi-Tiered System of Supports) at their placement sites to expand their opportunities for meeting internship goals and competencies. The training program is a full-time experience that begins in August and concludes in June of the following year. Orientation takes place at the WBES office located in Exeter, NH, which serves as a hub for didactic training, supervision, and administrative processes. Placed in a New Hampshire school district, interns complete a minimum of 1,500 supervised hours and average 15-20 hours of direct face-to-face clinical hours per week. Interns in this program are referred to as “School Psychology Fellows” and are matched with a district with which WBES partners. Interns spend 35 hours per week in the school setting and a minimum of 4 hours a week at the WBES office, where they receive direct supervision with a licensed psychologist, group supervision, didactic training, and protected time to meet with members of their cohort. Interns follow a successive training schedule as they assume increased responsibility and independence in specialized assessment and consultation activities. WBES supervisors utilize the Developmental, Ecological, Problem-Solving (DEP) model of supervision, focusing on the development of clinical skills and addressing issues such as professionalism, ethics, and diversity. The program is organized in a way that provides interns with an opportunity not only to combine all their previously learned skills and knowledge in a professional service delivery system but also to apply these skills under supervision to benefit those they serve.

These agencies offer a broad range of training experiences to doctoral interns from clinical or counseling psychology programs. We strive to tailor the training experience to the intern’s unique needs and interests while providing regular assessment of progress in order to ensure that training goals are met. WCPIP prepares generalist practitioners to have entry-level skills by the end of the year. As the year ends, primary interns are expected to provide the same range of services as permanent staff at their primary site. We are aware of the developmental nature of the intern experience and strive to provide necessary supervision and support. Early in the year, more time may be spent on modeling, observing, recording, reviewing work samples, and/or co-therapy. As the year progresses, interns are expected to operate with increasing autonomy. This is evidenced by interns handling greater caseloads and demonstrating expansion of their skills and thinking about cases, self, and professional issues. Interns spend 4 days a week at their primary agency and 1 day at a secondary agency (often referred to as the intern's ""switch site""). The primary agency is determined through the APPIC Match, and each agency within the consortium has a unique match number. The year-long placement at the secondary agency is determined by the intern and their supervisors during the first week of internship. This structure ensures that each intern has a unique training experience tailored to their needs and interests, while also benefiting from the collegiality and support of the internship cohort. While the training emphasis is on provision of clinical services, training opportunities in program development, diversity and inclusion, clinical administration, research, and QI initiatives may be available if interns are interested. Each agency in the consortium offers unique training experiences, intern expectations, and employee benefits. Please see our website for more comprehensive descriptions. Prairie View, Inc. is an innovative multi-site agency offering a range of behavioral health services. Prairie View offers a full-model DBT program and interns are integral members of the treatment team. Flexible opportunities exist to assess and treat individuals across the lifespan. Interns work primarily at the Wichita location with opportunities at other agency sites. KUSM-W is a community-based medical school that educates physicians, pharmacists, psychologists, and neuropsychologists, among other health-related professionals. The internship positions are housed within the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. The Neuropsychology Track offers training consistent with Houston Conference and Division 40 recommendations. Interns gain independence in all aspects of neuropsychological evaluation with adults and older adults, including outpatient evaluations and neuropsychological consultation on an inpatient Senior Behavioral Unit. Training prepares interns to secure competitive neuropsychology fellowship positions and ultimately achieve board certification in clinical neuropsychology. The Clinical Child Psychology Track offers training in evidence-based interventions and assessments for children and adolescents. Interns provide outpatient psychotherapy, neuropsychological and neurodevelopmental assessment, and inpatient consultation/liaison services, with flexibility in the balance of each depending on the intern’s training and career goals. Opportunities for school-based mental health services and other outreach programs may be available. WSU CAPS is a university counseling center that provides mental health treatment, training, and prevention services to the only urban-serving university in the state of Kansas.

Graduates of our program are recognizes as having completed an APA accredited internship program. Questions related to the program’s accreditation status should be directed to: Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation American Psychological Association 750 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 2000202 Phone: (202) 336-5979 E-mail: apaaccred@apa.org Web: https://accreditation.apa.org/ The mission of the Wilmington VA Medical Center’s Psychology Internship Program is to develop competent psychologists dedicated to delivering proficient, ethical, evidenced-based psychological treatment. Our graduates will demonstrate strong professional and leadership skills in the provision of clinical treatment in a multitude of settings. The Psychology Internship Program is based on a practitioner-scholar model of professional psychology. Interns are trained to utilize critical thinking and analytical skills in applying empirical knowledge and relevant theoretical frameworks to the veterans they are treating. The training model provides supervised experiences in professional skills that are sequential, cumulative, and graded in complexity. The internship prepares interns to function as generalists within a medical center setting, with opportunities to develop skills in specialty areas. We expect our graduates to provide comprehensive assessments of behavioral, cognitive, and emotional problems, to deliver a wide variety of therapeutic interventions tailored to the needs of various clinical settings, to function effectively as consultants in health care settings and as members of treatment teams, and to practice in a highly ethical and professional manner, acknowledging cultural and individual differences and using scientific literature to inform clinical decisions Treatment is provided by interdisciplinary teams with a biopsychosocial model as an overarching framework. Consideration of psychological and social functioning in addition to biology improves the understanding of health and disease, as well as the ability of the team to align with and assist veterans. As a member of an interdisciplinary treatment team designed to treat the whole person, interns learn about the perspectives and contributions of other professionals. The training program is committed to the provision of recovery-oriented care that maximizes individual strength, promotes human dignity, and values individual difference. The Wilmington VA Behavioral Health Services strives to empower veterans through education regarding their diagnosis and treatment options. Veterans are treated as educated consumers and work collaboratively with the treatment team to develop an individualized treatment plan that reflects their readiness, needs, and values.

In our system, the most common reasons applicants may fail to pass are: 1. A pending charge and/or past conviction relevant to the duties and responsibilities of the position. 2. Current or recent (within the past 5 years) probation/parole or being under the supervision of a federal, state or local law enforcement agency. Anyone with concerns about passing the criminal background check should consult with the Internship Director (DOCPsychologyInternship@Wisconsin.gov) for further information or clarification. In addition, a current, valid, and unrestricted driver's license is necessary. Program Description The internship offers a multitude of placement opportunities. We have two placement hubs (with separate match numbers to allow applicants to prioritize location) in two distinct areas of the state: Milwaukee and Northeast Wisconsin (Oshkosh/Appleton areas). Five interns are assigned to each hub. The internship previously offered a placement hub in the Madison area, which may be an option again in the future, pending availability of training sites. Each intern is assigned from two to four primary rotations based on availability and the intern's interests and needs (i.e., two rotations at any one time). One rotation may be for the entire year, while the others are for six months each. One day of the week is devoted to training seminars and group supervision. The internship provides a range of experiences in basic clinical practice with a diverse population including assessment, individual and group psychotherapy, crisis intervention, and consultation with other staff. Interns receive speciality training in sex offender evaluation and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). Training seminars are conducted with interns from other Wisconsin doctoral internships, including Mendota Mental Health Institute (MMHI). Interns may have the opportunity to visit and tour other correctional facilities in the state. Although this internship takes place in a correctional setting, the experiences are carefully selected to provide interns with general clinical experiences. The interns usually provide services to male and female correctional clients in both community and institutional placements. The internship serves adults. Interns work with offenders who have a range of mental health disorders. The focus is on providing a ""clinical"" rather than only a ""correctional"" internship experience. We provide an extensive didactic training sequence. Previous didactic topics have included: Violence risk assessment; Competency Evaluation; Personality Disorders; Dialectical Behavior Therapy; Counseling LGBTQ; Detection of Malingering (1)Instruments and (2)Theory; Diversity and Class; Gangs in Wisconsin; Psychopathy; Female Sex Offenders; Interventions with Gender Dysphoric Inmates; Licensure in Wisconsin; Mental Health Law; Mock Trial; Motivational Interviewing; Overview of Neuropsychological Assessment; NGRI Defense; Positive Psychology; Psychopharmacology; Schizophrenia; Sex Offender Evaluation; STATIC-99R; STABLE-2007; Student Loan Repayment; Supervision; HCR-20; PAI; Opioids; Self-Harm; Violence Risk Scale-Sex Offender version; MMPI-3. Note: Topics are subject to change annually. Interns are required to present for about 30 minutes on their doctoral research, or another research topic with which they are familiar, at an annual Internship Colloquium, attended by psychologists who evaluate the presentation and earn Continuing Education credits. Interns who participate in an advanced forensic rotation have the opportunity to participate in a mock trial experience which is coordinated by the Mendota Mental Health Institute (MMHI).

Approximately 42% of male persons in our care have a mental health condition. Of those, about 7% have a severe and persistent mental illness. About 91% of female persons in our care have a mental health condition, with approximately 26% having a severe and persistent mental illness. Individuals with mental health disorders are also assessed and treated in Community Corrections, which is a rotation that is available in all three hubs. Currently, about 94% of offenders supervised by the Department of Corrections are male and about half of that number are from minority groups (African American, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Native American/Alaskan Native). Less than 20 percent reside in correctional facilities, with the remainder living in their home communities on probation or parole/extended-supervision status. Interns do a significant amount of their clinical work with minority group offenders and offenders who represent a wide range of ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic diversity. An understanding of and respect for this cultural diversity is essential. The offender population reflects the entire range of psychological pathology. Diagnoses include acute and chronic cognitive, emotional, and personality disorders and adjustment reactions. Alcohol and drug addictions are common, as are a variety of sexual psychopathologies. Approximately 25% have an active conviction for a sexual offense. Violent victimization of others, domestic violence, sexual offending, and sequelae of their own childhood victimization are frequent treatment issues. In addition to these problems, many offenders experience emotional or behavioral crises related to incarceration and concomitant separation from family and friends, or problems inherent in release to the community (e.g., lack of job-seeking skills, fear of responsibility, marital stress, and unresolved substance or other addictions). Special housing units exist for mentally ill offenders who are unable to function in general population and for some high-risk sex offenders. For example, a Special Management Unit (SMU) at one maximum-security institution houses more than 100 mentally ill offenders in an inpatient-type setting. Another 100 bed special unit at a medium security institution exists for high risk sex offenders participating in an intensive two-year residential treatment program. Other institutions provide residential programs for offenders who are dually-diagnosed with both a severe mental illness and one or more substance use disorders. An affiliated psychiatric treatment facility, the Wisconsin Resource Center (WRC), is staffed by the Department of Health Services (DHS) to provide treatment for acutely mentally ill offenders. Opportunities exist for training and/or experience with specilized treatment modalities such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM), and Moral Reconation Therapy (MRT). There also is specialized training available in sexual offender risk assessment and treatment.

Program Description Womack Army Medical Center's (WAMC) APA-accredited Clinical Psychology Internship Program (CPIP), located at Fort Bragg, NC, develops highly qualified and autonomous Army psychologists through a Practitioner-Scholar model. The program emphasizes evidence-based adult assessment, psychotherapeutic interventions, and clinical consultation. It offers specialty training in assessment, personnel selection, health psychology, and postconcussive evaluations. The CPIP prepares interns for Army practice by focusing on efficient clinical services to a diverse Active Duty population, utilizing an integrative model. Adult Outpatient/Behavioral Health Officer (BHO) Rotation : Training at WAMC is designed to prepare Interns for the requirements of Active Duty service as psychologists, capable of practicing all of the major professional skills flexibly within a given week. Therefore, we utilize a “Train-as-You-Fight” model that allows Interns to gradually develop, balance, and integrate all the skills of professional psychologists during an extended 9-month BHO Rotation. Interns learn to simultaneously conduct behavioral health evaluations, provide follow-up treatment for diverse Active Duty patients, carry a small caseload of psychotherapy patients, assess and manage risk, and conduct military-specific evaluations – all while effectively managing their own self-care. Interns demonstrating satisfactory progress may apply for a three-month elective rotation, awarded based on merit and programmatic training needs: Operational Rotation : This three-month rotation serves as an introduction to military Special Operations, and provides Trainees opportunities to observe and practice the fundamentals of occupational assessment and selection, leadership development and coaching, and performance enhancement skills. This rotation includes an introduction to the literature and instruments involved in assessment and selection, instruction and training in persuasion and influence, and observation of how these skills are utilized to support military Special Operations. Department of Brain Injury Medicine Rotation : This rotation offers comprehensive experience in assessing and treating individuals with TBIs and related conditions within a multidisciplinary setting at the Intrepid Spirit. Interns attend meetings, contribute to treatment planning, lead group meetings, and conduct individual evaluations with significant engagement in two intensive outpatient programs. The Return to Forces (RTF) program for Special Operations personnel and the Cognitive Health Program (CHP) for Service Members with post-TBI symptoms allows Interns to deliver psychoeducation, trauma-informed interventions, and assist with neuropsychological screenings. The RTF program provides interns with an opportunity to engage in interdisciplinary exercises and training such as equine therapy, battlefield acupuncture, art therapy, yoga, and other holistic treatments alongside patients. Primary Care Rotation : On this three-month rotation, Interns work directly in a health psychology setting with psychologists serving as Internal Behavioral Health Consultants in a patient-centered medical clinic. Interns learn how to complete rapid evaluations of patients presenting with a variety of symptoms and concerns including but not limited to anxiety, insomnia, weight reduction, medical treatment adherence, lifestyle management, tobacco cessation, and diabetes management. Neuropsychology Rotation: Interns receive an introduction to neuropsychological principles, develop understanding of the basics of traumatic brain injury evaluation, and receive exposure to treating post-concussive symptoms at the National Intrepid Center of Excellence satellite location at Fort Bragg. They also learn the fundamentals of cognitive assessment and neuropsychological report writing under teh supervision of a licensed neuropsychologist. Child & Family Behavioral Health Services (CAFBHS) Rotation : CAFBHS provides clinical psychology and psychiatry services to children and adolescents between the ages of four to eighteen and to adult dependent spouses - including individual, couples, and family therapy with integration of parent training interventions. Components of this rotation include assessment, treatment, and risk management for members of military families. The School Behavioral Health Program, a component of CAFBHS, affords opportunities to provide clinical services in a school setting and participate in multidisciplinary team collaboration.

Our program decided to offer an on-site option based on feedback from previous interview days and given the commitment required from those who are selected for our internship to be a commissioned Air Force officer, we wanted to ensure interested candidates were provided an optional exposure experience to assist with their decision-making process. The virtual option is tentatively scheduled for December 05, 2025 and the on-site option will be tentatively held on January 12, 2026. Interview days will be an opportunity to learn more about our program, our faculty, what it is like to be a psychologist in the US Air Force, and for our faculty to learn more about your experiences, interests, and your desires for internship and a career in the US Air Force.

Our graduates are trained to advance the Air Force mission by providing evidence-based care to meet the mental health needs of our service members, their family members, and our retired population. Air Force psychologists also serve as their base’s behavioral health subject matter experts; therefore, interns are trained in providing expert consultation to military leadership and medical colleagues as well as advising on population-based preventive services. Since our graduates begin their careers with a high degree of responsibility as officers within the Air Force, we are committed to helping them develop the capacity to function adeptly as autonomous professionals at Air Force bases throughout the United States and around the world. Our faculty are committed to training competent, ethical, and culturally humble psychologists who integrate patient specific factors grounded in principles of behavioral science to alleviate suffering, promote well-being, and advance military readiness. Required core rotations include didactic instruction and supervised practice in the areas of: Outpatient Mental Health Clinical Health Psychology Neuropsychology Primary Care Behavioral Health Additional experiences are available in: Embedded Mental Health Track Mental Health Clinic Leadership Aerospace Psychology Crisis Assessment and Intervention Immersive Military Unit Activities Those who have made sufficient progress on their dissertation will be enrolled in our Embedded Mental Health Track. They will gain knowledge and experience of providing behavioral health services outside of clinical settings (e.g., Assessment and Selection of special forces personnel, command consultation, population health interventions). For those requiring additional time to complete their dissertation, we will provide a dedicated 4 weeks to aid in completion. A minimum of 2 to 3 hours per week of individual supervision is augmented by a robust program of didactics, case conferences, group/peer supervision, journal clubs, and workshops. Our program is enhanced by ongoing interdisciplinary clinical and educational collaboration with our Psychiatry and Social Work staff and residents.

We are focused on attracting, training and retaining dedicated trainees and professionals to the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. We seek to train entry-level clinicians in how to integrate the discipline and practice of professional psychology within community and primary care settings. We do this by employing an empirically informed, competency-based, practitioner-scholar model. We are staffed by licensed psychologists, psychiatrists, postdoctoral psychology fellows, and masters level clinicians with a wide variety of training and expertise between them. BMP is physically housed on the Berkely Medical Center (BMC) campus, which is part of the WVU Medicine system. Ours is a primarily outpatient mental health clinic serving residents of the tristate area (West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland). Interns will primarily train in this setting; although, they will also have direct care experience and be trained in the Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) model through our integrated primary care clinic in Harpers Ferry, WV. Interns in our program will have opportunities to provide services to children, adults and families from a wide range of backgrounds, including particular focus on helping underserved populations. Presenting problems include a wide range of mental and physical health conditions, and services provided include psychological and educational testing, individual therapy, brief therapy, crisis intervention, and consultation. We provide opportunities to undergo additional training in many areas including but not limited to trauma-based interventions, diabetes and obesity management at the Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Health, family therapy, and others depending on interns' interest and the availability of particular patient populations. Finally, interns will engage in one research project and one advocacy project throughout their training year.

Please review details on the website at https://medicine.yale.edu/psychiatry/psychology/education/predoc/sites/ Program Description Yale offers one of the nation’s premier internships in clinical and community psychology, which has been accredited by APA since 1970. In 2023, the training program was reviewed by the APA and earned reaccreditation for an additional 10 years. The next review is December 2032. Up to 14 interns train each year in one of 10 placements within a vibrant academic medical center where the emphasis is on state-of-the-art clinical care, professional education, and research. Interns have placements at either Yale-New Haven Hospital or the Connecticut Mental Health Center. The training program embraces a scientist-practitioner model in which theory and evidence inform professional practice and each intern has protected time to pursue a scholarly activity. The internship is part of a nurturing professional community of psychologists that values and promotes diversity among the faculty, interns, populations served, and theoretical perspectives. A priority is placed on professional development, including assistance to students in securing opportunities after internship. Each year, many graduating interns remain at Yale to pursue postdoctoral training and research (though postdoctoral positions are neither promised nor guaranteed). There are over 200 psychology faculty members in the Psychiatry Department and they are leaders in the field as evidenced by their record of grants, publications, awards, and roles in professional organizations and government-sponsored boards and committees.

Program Description The YCS Institute currently offers two internship tracks: the Institute Track and the Bilingual Spanish Track. Both tracks provide opportunities to work with infants, children, adolescents, and adult caregivers, with treatment informed by attachment, object relations, developmental, and family systems orientations. In both tracks, interns work with clients across the lifespan, providing individual play therapy, parent consultation, family therapy, and dyadic (parent–child) psychotherapy in our outpatient clinic. The Bilingual Spanish Track is designed for interns who are fluent in Spanish and English and wish to focus more heavily on serving Hispanic and Latinx children and families, while still gaining experience with a wide range of clients and presenting concerns. All interns provide outpatient services at their primary site and also complete rotations to broaden their experience. Treatment cases may span from birth through adulthood, while assessment opportunities include clients from birth through age 21. Assessment batteries cover cognition, achievement, and personality functioning, with training in the Rorschach preferred. Interns receive individual and group supervision and participate in weekly didactic seminars and case conferences.

We look for interns with training goals aligned with the training that we offer. The program looks not only at the total number of practicum hours, but the quality of training in terms of the type of setting and population, as well as experience with evidence-based practice. We prefer interns who have training and experience in working with youth and families and those who, based on their experience, demonstrate cultural sensitivity working with diverse populations. However, we will consider candidates with gaps in this training who demonstrate great potential and an eagerness to learn based on strong letters of recommendation, essays, and interviews. All applications are screened by the Youth Services Department Training Committee using a standard Application Rating Scale and evaluated for potential goodness of fit with the internship program. The Training Committee holds a selection meeting to determine which applicants to invite for interviews based upon the results of this screening process. All applicants are notified by email of a decision regarding an invitation to interview on the date indicated in the APPIC directory. Interviews are scheduled during the month of January and occur remotely via video technology with members of the Training Committee. Interviews entail a half-day experience involving various activities. Specifically, on the day of the interview, a small group of intern applicants (typically 3-5) meets with the internship’s Training Director and other supervising psychologists for introductions, a pre-recorded overview of the site and various training opportunities, and a virtual tour of both internship rotations. As a group, prospective interns also are given a clinical scenario and asked to discuss the scenario in a group format in front of the supervising psychologists. Subsequently, prospective interns meet individually with outpatient and residential supervising psychologists as well as postdoctoral fellows during which interviews are conducted using a standard set of interview questions; although members of the Training Committee may ask additional interview questions of applicants as appropriate. Applicants are afforded an opportunity to ask questions during their group meeting and individual interview times, time permitting. As a group, applicants also meet with current interns as another opportunity to ask questions and learn about the training experience. The Youth Services Department agrees to abide by the APPIC policy that no person at this training facility will solicit, accept, or use any rank information from any internship applicant.

Program Description Internship Program Description: The Doctoral Internship at the Youth Services Department is offered through the Residential Treatment and Family Counseling Division, whose mission is to provide free, accessible, professional trauma-informed mental health services and educational programs to youth and families in Palm Beach County to support healthy development and promote overall wellbeing. The Division is committed to fostering healthy individual and family functioning in families where youth have been exposed to various forms of danger, harm, or loss. Without adequate resilience and other protective factors, these youth are often at higher risk of trauma and toxic stress, that if left unaddressed, may lead to increased use of unhealthy behaviors, which in turn increases their risk of entering the juvenile justice system, dropping out of school, getting involved with gangs, running away from home, substance use, and entering the child protective system. This goal is accomplished through family, group, and individual therapy, psychoeducation, parent training, psychological evaluation, consultative services, and community outreach offered across community-based, office, and residential settings. Services are provided free to Palm Beach County residents with youth up to age 22. Internship clinical activities will emphasize family therapy using a brief therapy model, and also include group and individual therapy, psychoeducation, parent training, risk assessment and crisis intervention, psychological evaluation, multidisciplinary consultation, case management, and community outreach offered across community-based, office, and residential settings. Each intern completes a six-month residential rotation at Highridge Family Center and a six-month outpatient rotation at the Education & Training Center, which together provide a range of clinical and didactic experiences that will support interns in the development of competencies necessary for psychologists. By the end of the internship year, interns are well-prepared with the knowledge, awareness, and skills of a practitioner specializing in youth and families. Highridge Family Center – Residential Rotation During the residential rotation at Highridge Family Center, interns, under the supervision of licensed psychologists, are responsible for providing family, group, individual, and milieu therapy to residents of Highridge, working in the same capacity as staff therapists. Additionally, interns participate in weekly multidisciplinary treatment team meetings, case conferences, staff consultations, and presentations to parents. Education & Training - Outpatient Rotation During the outpatient rotation at the Education & Training Center, interns are responsible for providing short-term (3-4 months) family therapy, individual therapy (only ages 18-22), intake assessments, provisional diagnosis, treatment planning and implementation, consultation, and case management. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT; ages 2-7) may also be provided under the direction of a Certified PCIT Therapist. Interns also complete psychological evaluations, provide parent education/support/training, and conduct outreach activities, including presentations to staff, schools, and community agencies. Throughout the internship, two hours of weekly didactic training on a variety of clinical topics are provided. Interns also develop and present a presentation to a professional audience. In addition, interns participate in monthly Journal Club and Supervision Series meetings, where discussions of research articles/empirical literature related to clinical challenges and supervisory skill development take place. Interns participate in a Testing Training Series and Training Director Meetings as well. The internship integrates a practitioner-scholar model with psychological training and service delivery that is sequential, cumulative, and graded in complexity. The practitioner-scholar training model emphasizes the integration and application of critical thinking and skillful reflection across a broad range of experiential activities. The internship program is committed to evidenced-based practice by integrating the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences. By the end of the internship year, interns are prepared with the knowledge, awareness, and skills of a practitioner specializing in youth and families. Our interns are well prepared for professional careers working with children and their families in a residential or outpatient setting who present with a wide range of concerns. *Please see the Internship Handbook on our website for a complete description of the program.
